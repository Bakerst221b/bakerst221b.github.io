    <h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/blog/2022/02/jigsaw/"> Game Over</a></h2> 
    <p> <p><em>One sunny 😎 day I came to a coworking office very early in the morning. As usual, I&rsquo;ve decided to kick it off with a freshly brewed coffee which we never had, so, I had to go with an instant substitute. Ugh 😣! I was hoping to savour my disgust meditating over the Feedly recents, when I noticed that I was not the only lark that day. Mark, a freelance designer who happened to be a huge fan of Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games (just like me), was sitting in the corner of the shared kitchen with his laptop, looking so gloomy that I was sorry I didn&rsquo;t take my ☔️ with me. When I&rsquo;ve forced the last sip of that potion inside, I wished him good morning and headed to my working nest. He didn&rsquo;t respond though, which was weird, since he usually was very friendly. I thought he needed some time on his own and was about to leave the kitchen when suddenly he hailed me. Long story short, he seemed to get himself a virus and didn&rsquo;t know how to get rid of it. He seemed scared, since lots of important files were encrypted.</em></p></p>

    <p> <p>⛔️  Spoiler alert!</p>
<h2 id="case-details">Case Details</h2>
<p>This is not an investigation like the previous one. This is threat hunting. So, we have only logs via Kibana available. To harden my knowledge with this technologies I&rsquo;ve had a very quick overview on ElasticStack website and enrolled in <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/threat-hunting-with-the-elastic-stack">this</a> course. Basically, I will have to answer questing having a loads of logs and a query engine available.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="1-wmi-event-consumer-name">1. WMI Event Consumer name?</h3>
<p>✅ <em>The Threat Hunting process usually starts with the analyst making a hypothesis about a possible compromise vector or techniques used by an attacker. In this scenario, your initial hypothesis is as follows: &ldquo;The attacker used the WMI subscription mechanism to obtain persistence within the infrastructure&rdquo;. Verify this hypothesis and find the name of the WMI Event Consumer used by the attacker to maintain his foothold.</em></p></p>

    <p> <p>⛔️  Spoiler alert!</p>
<h2 id="case-details">Case Details</h2>
<p><strong>Artefacts in posession</strong>: memory dump, OS event logs, registry files, Prefetch files, $MFT file, ShimCache, AmCache, network traffic dumps. I&rsquo;ve decided to analyse each artefact, what can I get from it in this specific case and how. Then, I am going to outline my strategy in approaching this case.</p>
<p>We are looking for indicators of compromise.  There are no details as to what is the group and what was its aim. But it’s known that there was abnormal traffic detected that has launched this IR process. So, at least, we must have some suspicious traffic, possibly open or terminated connections. These should have been launched by some process, so we are looking for malware. Also, since the attacker needed an account to get in, I will be looking for an account take over attempts and possibly, new account creation.</p></p>

<p>This one is one of the simplest to explain and not that simple to actually use in a real attack (see Caveats). A malicious DLL&rsquo;s <strong>path</strong> is copied in the memory space of a legitimate running process to be loaded in runtime.</p>

<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<p>There are several keys that are used in this play. Three keys exist at the very begining. A user has his green key, TGS has its yellow one and the HTTP server has a black one. Each key is private to the party and is not know by other parties. Two more keys are generated during the authentication process: a purple and a crimson one. Keys also need to be printer out: one copy for green, black and yellow keys and two copies for purple and crimson ones. Here is the ininital &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</p></p>

<p><em>It was a very sunny day and a very nice a long walk that my daughter and I had before lunch. I feel uplifted because there is finally enough sun and green grass in my life! Unfortunately, no coffee today, since we don&rsquo;t have BonAcqua, which might be not the best for drinking, but is indeed one of the best to prepare coffee (quoting my husband).</em></p></p>
