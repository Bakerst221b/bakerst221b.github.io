      <description>&lt;p&gt;*This article centres around the crowned queen of the Windows kingdom: LSA (&lt;code&gt;lsass.exe&lt;/code&gt;), a darling among attackers for the sheer power it wields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*There are a lot of techniques to become persistent on a Windows machine. You can refer to the persistence and escalation mechanisms article or look those up on the MITRE website. Although it&amp;rsquo;s important to know the artefacts themselves and the technique, it would be hard to collect them all manually. *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>🔎 Detection and Investigation Techniques</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/techniques/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One can detect something automatically or look for it. So, the investigation (incident response and digital forensics) can either start from a security alert or threat-hunting. What are artefacts, and how are they different from evidence? What types of artefacts are there, and how to look them out? Let&amp;rsquo;s dive deeper into what techniques are used to spot the attacker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For details on reverse engineering - refer to the Reverse 🔧 section of this website. I will only look into the simple static and dynamic analysis (using tools without running the file and running it- to see where it poos 💩).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data about a file is stored in several locations: system metadata (generated by the file system or doc management of the OS), substantive metadata (information that defines modifications to a document), embedded metadata (information embedded by the application that creates or edits the file), external metadata (separate doc, for example, a database).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File infectors:&lt;/strong&gt; These viruses infect executable files and are spread when the infected file is executed. When an infected file is run, the virus code is activated and can spread to other files on the system. Examples include the Cascade virus and the Jerusalem virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot sector viruses: These viruses infect the boot sector of a disk, usually a floppy disk, and are activated when the computer is booted from the infected disk. The virus then spreads to other disks that are accessed by the infected system. Examples include the Stoned virus and the Michelangelo virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro viruses: These viruses infect documents that contain macro code, such as Microsoft Word or Excel documents. When the infected document is opened, the virus code is executed and can infect other documents on the system. Examples include the Melissa virus and the ILOVEYOU virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stealth viruses: These viruses are designed to hide their presence from antivirus software and other detection methods. They do this by intercepting system calls and modifying the results, or by hooking into the operating system and altering its behavior. Examples include the Whale virus and the Meve virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multipartite viruses: These viruses infect both files and boot sectors, making them harder to detect and remove. They typically spread through infected files and then infect the boot sector of the system, allowing them to survive a system reboot. Examples include the Flip virus and the Invader virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polymorphic viruses: These viruses use encryption or other techniques to change their code each time they infect a new system, making them difficult to detect and remove. Examples include the W95/CIH virus and the Satanbug virus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worms: While not technically viruses, worms are self-replicating malware that spread through networks or the internet. They typically exploit vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to spread, and can cause significant damage to systems and networks. Examples include the Morris worm and the WannaCry worm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Game Over</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/blog/2022/02/jigsaw/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One sunny 😎 day I came to a coworking office very early in the morning. As usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to kick it off with a freshly brewed coffee which we never had, so, I had to go with an instant substitute. Ugh 😣! I was hoping to savour my disgust meditating over the Feedly recents, when I noticed that I was not the only lark that day. Mark, a freelance designer who happened to be a huge fan of Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed games (just like me), was sitting in the corner of the shared kitchen with his laptop, looking so gloomy that I was sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t take my ☔️ with me. When I&amp;rsquo;ve forced the last sip of that potion inside, I wished him good morning and headed to my working nest. He didn&amp;rsquo;t respond though, which was weird, since he usually was very friendly. I thought he needed some time on his own and was about to leave the kitchen when suddenly he hailed me. Long story short, he seemed to get himself a virus and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to get rid of it. He seemed scared, since lots of important files were encrypted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;⛔️  Spoiler alert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-details&#34;&gt;Case Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an investigation like the previous one. This is threat hunting. So, we have only logs via Kibana available. To harden my knowledge with this technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve had a very quick overview on ElasticStack website and enrolled in &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/threat-hunting-with-the-elastic-stack&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; course. Basically, I will have to answer questing having a loads of logs and a query engine available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-wmi-event-consumer-name&#34;&gt;1. WMI Event Consumer name?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ &lt;em&gt;The Threat Hunting process usually starts with the analyst making a hypothesis about a possible compromise vector or techniques used by an attacker. In this scenario, your initial hypothesis is as follows: &amp;ldquo;The attacker used the WMI subscription mechanism to obtain persistence within the infrastructure&amp;rdquo;. Verify this hypothesis and find the name of the WMI Event Consumer used by the attacker to maintain his foothold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;⛔️  Spoiler alert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-details&#34;&gt;Case Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artefacts in posession&lt;/strong&gt;: memory dump, OS event logs, registry files, Prefetch files, $MFT file, ShimCache, AmCache, network traffic dumps. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to analyse each artefact, what can I get from it in this specific case and how. Then, I am going to outline my strategy in approaching this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for indicators of compromise.  There are no details as to what is the group and what was its aim. But it’s known that there was abnormal traffic detected that has launched this IR process. So, at least, we must have some suspicious traffic, possibly open or terminated connections. These should have been launched by some process, so we are looking for malware. Also, since the attacker needed an account to get in, I will be looking for an account take over attempts and possibly, new account creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a geometric arrangment of hosts and network devices. Can be physical (cables and PCs&amp;rsquo; layout) or logical (informaiton transmission methods).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bus&#34;&gt;Bus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid latency, 5 PC max. Thin 10BASE2 (black) or thick 10BASE5 (yellow). 1 failes - all fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt;: UTP 10BASET (blue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low cost. 1 fails - net still on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GCFA Study Plan 🗒</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/notes/gcfa/1-plan/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/notes/gcfa/1-plan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is my GCFA study plan. I hope it will help me in organizing and prioritising the topics to learn and also in estimating the time I need to get ready. There are two plans that I&amp;rsquo;ve used: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-forensic-analyst-gcfa&#34;&gt;exam plan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-incident-response-threat-hunting-training/#__utma=183869984.1662005416.1609691511.1609691511.1609691511.1&amp;amp;__utmb=183869984.2.9.1609691519154&amp;amp;__utmc=183869984&amp;amp;__utmx=-&amp;amp;__utmz=183869984.1609691511.1.1.utmcsr=google%7Cutmccn=(organic)%7Cutmcmd=organic%7Cutmctr=(not%20provided)&amp;amp;__utmv=-&amp;amp;__utmk=99012638&#34;&gt;official course plan&lt;/a&gt;. On the exam description page there is stated that:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Specific training is required for any GIAC certification. There are many sources of information available regarding the certification objectives&amp;rsquo; knowledge areas. Practical experience is an option; there are also numerous books on the market covering Computer Information Security. Another option is any relevant courses from training providers, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.giac.org/registration/certified-forensic-analyst-gcfa&#34;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A user, who&amp;rsquo;s the owner of the file or another object defines who can and who cannot view it. It&amp;rsquo;s not safe, but it is easier to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Discretionary Access Control (DAC):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discretionary Access Control is an access control model where the owner of a resource has full control over granting or restricting access permissions to that resource. In DAC, the owner can decide who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it (e.g., read, write, or execute).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the process of investigating Toy PD &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve realised I lack the information about different browser files. This is an attempt to fill that gap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many browsers are based on Chromium engine, that’s why they will have similar artifacts: Chrome, Opera, new Edge, Brave, Vivaldi. Also, there are lots of Electron applications that share some artifacts with them. Chrome is the point of convergence for all these application. On Magnet Summit it was suggested to explore and learn Chrome and it’s artifacts as well as OS common artifacts due to its popularity and reusing some of its components.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;classic&#34;&gt;Classic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is one of the simplest to explain and not that simple to actually use in a real attack (see Caveats). A malicious DLL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;path&lt;/strong&gt; is copied in the memory space of a legitimate running process to be loaded in runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APM and APFS seem to be unable to live together. APFS requires GUID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/artefacts/fs/partiation-schemas/gpt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GUID is an identifier of the following format: 8-4-4-4-12. There is still a protective MBR at 0 so that Windows will not try to format the disk. Up to 128 partitions, each entry is 128 bytes long -&amp;gt; . The header is located in sector 1. Backup copy at the end of the disk. Uses GUID as partition identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to a 128 partitions, all of them can be set as bootable. Will still have a dummy MBR at sector 0 and it&amp;rsquo;s there for backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Primary partitions (bootable). Can have at most 4 bootable partitions, since it&amp;rsquo;s limited to 4 partition entries in parition table, each entry 16 bytes in length. 4 bytes for their size, hence max value in hex is &lt;code&gt;0xFF FF FF FF&lt;/code&gt;, hence max size of a partition is 2 Tb. It starts at sector &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s 512 bytes long (one sector) and it ends with &lt;code&gt;0x55 0xAA&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Overview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea of a buffer overflow attack is quite simple, though the implementation might initially be difficult to digest. I am exploring this notion and visualising it in this article.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mechanics&#34;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a job you don&amp;rsquo;t really like (I think most of us have had such an experience at least once in our life 😢). And also, imagine that you are being highly underpaid. Your job is simple and ridiculous: place rabbits 🐇 into one set of boxes and foxes 🦊 - into another. You happen to have 6 boxes 📦📦📦📦📦📦 for foxes 🦊 and 4 📦📦📦📦 for rabbits 🐇. However, you were given 4 rabbits 🐇🐇🐇🐇 and 7 foxes 🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊. So, one fox 🦊 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have its fox box 📦. However, there are also rabbit 🐇 boxes 📦 right nearby. So, even though you were explicitly told not to place foxes into rabbit boxes and vice versa since you don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit, you put a fox into a rabbit fox. What happens? One can only guess&amp;hellip; 🤔. Long story short: the fox eats the rabbit, and now you have 7 foxes and only 3 rabbits 🐇. Alas! If only you&amp;rsquo;d followed the manual 📖&amp;hellip;. Most likely, one would get fired after such a mistake, but we can&amp;rsquo;t fire the compiler, so that would happen if the developer was not using a memory-safe language or wasn&amp;rsquo;t careful enough. Now, to the technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>📚 TCP/IP Stack Overview</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/tcp-ip/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2020 15:20:08 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/tcp-ip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is an overview of TCP/IP protocol stack. I will cover in detail what happens when a request to, say, &lt;code&gt;bakerst221b.com&lt;/code&gt; is sent in the browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this famous OSI model&amp;hellip; If you have ever scratched the surface of network security, you must have heard of it. It&amp;rsquo;s an empermal model (like spherical eggs &amp;#x1f95a; in the vacuum - a joke from Big Bang Theory). It&amp;rsquo;s not a real thing, it&amp;rsquo;s more like a blueprint &amp;#x1f5fa;&amp;#xfe0f; for making real things. This model basically describes, what an empermal packet sent over network should approximately look like. It&amp;rsquo;s called a packet &amp;#x1f4e6; because it looks very much like one: your message wrapped in an envelope, wrapped in some paper, put into a box and sent via post office and finally delivered to the door. Comparing this process with mail services is not uncommon, but I will use it in my example. However, to make the process clearer, I&amp;rsquo;ve sacrificied some realism. Though it&amp;rsquo;s unreal, in my humble opinion it better describes the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keys&#34;&gt;Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several keys that are used in this play. Three keys exist at the very begining. A user has his green key, TGS has its yellow one and the HTTP server has a black one. Each key is private to the party and is not know by other parties. Two more keys are generated during the authentication process: a purple and a crimson one. Keys also need to be printer out: one copy for green, black and yellow keys and two copies for purple and crimson ones. Here is the ininital &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to dive into certain pecularities of how programs are outlined both in RAM and on disk when working as a malware analyst. One part of my job was to treat infected files. For that purpose I wrote remedy scripts. For them to work I had to have a solid underatanding where to perform the amputation. Since the topic might be a little confusing, I&amp;rsquo;ve published it here. Originally it was hand-written in my &amp;#x1f48e; notebook &amp;#x1f4d3;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Instant messaging with channels and file sharing. Also, provides logs and eDiscovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud-based, collection is not enough (non reviewable format), your plan matters, tons of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before copying evidence or making a disk image, one needs to sterilise the target media to ensure that data on that disk before this operation would not meddle with the evidence data. Several rounds of writing &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;s are usually enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ollision &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;etection - NICs have a module that detect abnormal voltage (collision).&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two types of acquisitions: live 🍀 and dead ☠️. Choosing based on the system&amp;rsquo;s initial state in question is usually preferable. So, for example, if the system is turned on, perform live acquisition first, capturing all volatile data that will be deleted after reboot. Otherwise, jump right to the dead acquisition (if the system is shut down).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If this system is running, capture the memory. Should be the first task. Memory stomping issues. Benchmark testing to determine RAM footprint, speed, writes etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark the tools. DumpIt - lightweight, Magnet RAM, Belkasoft, FTK (slow, highest footprint), Redline, Fast Dump (fdpro.exe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media matters. SSD, USB vs Magnetic media evidence disk (HDD)? USB 3 is cool. Storage check at least 1/3 more then the collected. Magnetic cheap, 2-4 Gb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VM vs physical. Different concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Proccess Memory Layout</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning of my career I found it hard to grasp the notion of memory layout and stack. Even when I read about it several times, it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel solid. That&amp;rsquo;s why I drew drew and drew. Because my mind prefers pictures, analogies, metaphors and examples! So, I&amp;rsquo;ve made that. May be someone finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;picture&#34;&gt;Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/memoryLayoutC.png&#34; alt=&#34;memoryLayoutC&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;metaphor-and-analogy&#34;&gt;Metaphor and Analogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about a good metaphor, but that was the extent of my imagination&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s say some weirdo (let&amp;rsquo;s call him Gargaralian) is piling up all the boring books he has &amp;#x1f4da; under the table because the appartment is too small and the luxury of having a bookcase is not an option available for him. Besides, the table is a little loose, so that pile of books could be like the fifth leg. Something like that:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For OneDrive the most useful artifacts are stored locally. If you get access to the account online - may see the deleted items and their versions. &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\logs&lt;/code&gt;. This folder contains &lt;code&gt;Personal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Common&lt;/code&gt;. Neither has anything of particular interest, but may be an indicator, that the software was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Business version of OneDrive adds a few lines of code to the start of every doc, thus MD5 hashes will differ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a protocol of TCP/IP suite, Data Link Layer. The first layer after physical layer is a data link layer and the protocol in use here is Ethernet II. Other protocols of this layer (not TCP/IP): . Network devices, protocols and attacks of the Data Link layer use a &lt;strong&gt;frame&lt;/strong&gt; as a unit of information. The devices of this layer know nothing about IP addresses or TCP/UDP ports. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with them since the protocols&amp;rsquo; headers only contain MAC addresses.  MAC addresses is all they know and care about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This type of acquisition can only happen on a live system. It&amp;rsquo;s quicker and easier than imaging the drive, but you will miss some data. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes the only way to collect data from a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Consists of sections, symbol table (name and current location of variable or function that can be referenced by other object files), relocation table (addresses referenced in this file that the linker must adjust when it knows the final memory layout) and debug info. A header that says where in the files the sections below are located  A (concatenated) text segment, which contains all the source code (with some missing addresses)  A (concatenated) data segment (which combines all data and the bss segments)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Everytime you receive messages fir these ports (say 1 to 10), also send them to the span port 25. But to turn it on, you need an access to switch&amp;rsquo;s config. Moreover, some switches are made in a way not to let span port talk, only listen. It&amp;rsquo;s a useful option for admins (basically turning a switch into some sort of lame hub).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watering hole&lt;/strong&gt; is an attack strategy in which an attacker guesses or observes which websites an organization often uses and infects one or more of them with malware. Eventually, some member of the targeted group will become infected [&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July, 2012. Several high-profile institutions (financial and tech sectors) were victimized by a watering hole attack.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, they e-mailed the tech giants and asked for it. The scheme that included setting up a fake business and sending phishing e-mails to employees of Facebook and Google. The scheme ultimately duped those multi-million dollar companies out of more than a hundred million in total between 2013 and 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Also, PsExec requires the DWORD called LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy in the registry under&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This attack started from stealing credentials from a vendor, using them to install malware on around 7500 self-checkout POS terminals and then stealing data. Went unnoticed for 5 months (April - Septemper 2014) and grabbed the data from 56 million credit and debit cards (useful for identity theft) and 53 million emails (useful for phishing). Investigation started on September, 2nd and on 8th indicated that the system was breached. They also offered free credit services to affected customers who use their payment card as early as April of 2014, and apologized for the data breach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;22 March, 2018 the City of Atlanta suffered from a ransomware attack. Many devices at City Hall were shutdown. SamSam Ransomware was to blame. Demanded $51000 and the city refused. Shutdown the main devices for 5 days. Many of the operations returned to the traditional handwriting 😊. Atlanta disabled WiFi at the airport up until the 2nd of April.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigation Tips</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/todo/cases/tips/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/todo/cases/tips/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Determine the investigation type since it will influence the data you need, the scope, extent and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ It&amp;rsquo;s a very important thing to note in case of IP (intellectual property cases). Ensure, that data and devices of the suspect are IMMEDIATLY preserved and not accessed by anyone. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s because of the timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;❓ &lt;em&gt;What is the case about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;❓ &lt;em&gt;What evidence do we expect to recover?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;❓ &lt;em&gt;Where is the evidence most likely located?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;❓ &lt;em&gt;What are the legal restrictions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;❓ &lt;em&gt;Who is involved and what&amp;rsquo;s their role?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a plan to collect the data. Each type of data will require separate plan. This plan should prioritise the sources and the order. For example, if you are dealing with a system that is turned on, first, take photos of the screen, then collect the volatile data (RAM) and them make a copy of a hard drive. Then turn it off and send to the lab in a safety bag. Maintain chain of custody.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For the most relevant scenarios, keeping playbooks and runbooks at your disposal is crucial. This will help you stay less stressed and be prepared for various outcomes. I have created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canva.com/design/DAFfIbPpEuo/Frhvq9uiLJssDby2MJtXJA/view?utm_content=DAFfIbPpEuo&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;amp;utm_source=sharebutton&#34;&gt;high-level overview of potential playbooks&lt;/a&gt; based on the MITRE ATTACK matrix, which includes guidelines for detection, investigation, and cleanup techniques. Runbooks, on the other hand, are highly detailed and technical instructions, such as &amp;ldquo;How to reset an account password&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;How to change an AWS EC2 inline policy.&amp;rdquo; One runbook can be referred to by several playbooks, which is perfectly fine. Consider playbooks as constructors with a relatively unique plan and runbooks as the specific steps linked to some or all of the described plan&amp;rsquo;s stages. Below is a part of the table I have mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vpn&#34;&gt;VPN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual private network. As an additional bonus - avoid bandwidth throttling (when ISP cuts your speed or bandwidth for certain resources like torrents). Also useful on public networks. VPN is like your representative in the Internet or your avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the two examples of using the Internet without a VPN or any other anonymising tool. The first connection (🥕 marked), is just a simple plaintext HTTP connection. The rest (🥒 and 🌽) show a very simplified HTTPS connection. Basically, ISP 🍋  won&amp;rsquo;t see the contents of the message with the SSL/TLS (HTTPS) in use, as well as a MiM, of course (both those that are within 👀🫐  and outside 👀🍆 your network).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two broad categories of core processes. Processes that initialize system environment and those that initialize the user environment. Whatever is the category, you need to know them well in order to detect abnormal things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A ‘without-reboot’ snapshot is equivalent to a live acquisition, and a snapshot with a reboot is more like a traditional powered-off. Sheward, Mike.

&lt;p&gt;Most of the devices keep some logs. As for the network-related issues are switches, routers, firewalls, IDS and IPS, web proxies, DC and authentication servers, DCHP servers and application servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIEMs are log aggregators. When configured correctly, all logs and events from all systems in the enterprise flows to a centralised repository where they can then be analysed. Sometimes these SIEM analyse what&amp;rsquo;s normal and what&amp;rsquo;s not. However, they are quite costly 💰.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;First of all, all the Apple devices support remote wiping which has evolved significantly over the year and now support Bluetooth. When I say wiping over Bluetooth, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the person wiping and the device need to be in the Bluetooth range (which is quite short). It could be an examiner with a Bluetooth enabled standing near the iPhone with Bluetooth on and the person of interest somewher within the range of the first responder. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try this myself, but I should. This is based on the interview given on the Surviving Digital Forensics podcast on T1 and T2 Apple devices and the challenges the forensic examiners now face.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many browsers are based on Chromium engine, that’s why they will have similar artifacts: Chrome, Opera, new Edge, Brave, Vivaldi. Also, there are lots of Electron applications that share some artifacts with them. Chrome is the point of convergence for all these application. On Magnet Summit it was suggested to explore and learn Chrome and it’s artifacts as well as OS common artifacts due to its popularity and reusing some of its components. Electron is a framework that is available for building applications, cross-platform. You’re creating a web-application that can be used as a desktop one (implementing both back- and frontend). Backend - node.js, and frontend - Chrome. So, a lot of artifacts can be shared with Chrome and buddies. It’s in wide use. For example, ⚠️ WhatsApp and Skype use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/artefacts/apple/apple-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications or even OS itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the keys that are protected by Secure Enclave. OS only sees Keychain, but the Security Enclave is separated. It&amp;rsquo;s asked to decrypt the information and it does just that returning the decrypted information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that there lives a vicious criminal 🦹 who&amp;rsquo;s stealing and deleting puppy photos from a preschool server. It&amp;rsquo;s a nasty bussiness that can get him in jail if he&amp;rsquo;s not cautious. He likes to keep everything on the mobile phone he has with him all the time even in the bathroom 🚽 and while taking a shower 🚿 (he&amp;rsquo;s very careful). He considers the photos to be completely safe since he has set up a PIN for the device only he knows. All his secrets and stuff that can potentially throw him into jail are all on this little piece of harware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suddenly some other guy rats 🐀 him out (because he is sure that&amp;rsquo;s beneath his dignity to do such a damage for little kids) and serious and righteous people in suits are comming to your home with a warrant 📄. Well, this criminal 🦹‍♀️  still thinks: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Hey, suckers, I&amp;rsquo;ve got everything on my mobile phone which is secure as hell. All other devices are completely wiped.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. How wrong would this assumption be? What if he had an old Android device? Or may be a iPhone 5S? Or iPhone 4? Is there really a difference? What if the only reasonable assumption in this case would be for him to pack ciggies 🚬  for the jail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main things to think about when answering the question: is the mobile phone&amp;rsquo;s NAND or NOR (i.e. non-volatile storage) encrypted? If it&amp;rsquo;s not, then, my dear fellow, he is in trouble. One could just extract this precious little chip and insert it into another device. Now they don&amp;rsquo;t need &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; passcode, they&amp;rsquo;d only require theirs or even none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, say, he was not complete dump and was smart enough to get himself a device📱that uses fulldisk encryption. Is this attack still feseable? Well, depends on where the key 🔑 is stored. If it&amp;rsquo;s, for example, stored at &lt;code&gt;0x0000000&lt;/code&gt; address of this NAND, then it&amp;rsquo;s just the question of extracting this chip, reading 📖 the first bytes and decrypting the contents. So, how and where to store this key in order to make this &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; harder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Apple has been doing for a while. It got so overwhelmed with this task that it happened to end up protecting its endusers even from themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then mobile devices had several basic parts: CPU, some storage chip (NAND or NOR) and some other pieces used to make it possible to use this for talking and SMS-ing. Apple has decided to apply the least-privilege policy here again and restrict the enduser to only those tasks he or she can possibly want to do. It&amp;rsquo;s a phone afterall. Why modifying OS? You don&amp;rsquo;t need it. Make you calls and be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Apple iDevices have two AES engines: one is for Secure Enclave only, another one is used both for SE and Application Processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the device is manufactured, a 256-bit AES key is written to Secure Enclave. Before some veresions of Apple devices these UIDs were randomly generated and them fused to the chip. However at the moment they are generated by SE during manufacturing and fused using special software. There is no API (neither software, nor hardware) that is able to get it from there, used only by the processor’s hardware AES engine. This UID key is unique for each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when user creates a passcode, it is turned into a cryptographic key and strengthened with the device’s UID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;PBKDF2&lt;/span&gt;(user_pass_derived_crypto_key, device_uid):

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;se_mem_key&lt;/code&gt; encrypts Secure Enclave&amp;rsquo;s memory space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In iOS and iPadOS, files are encrypted with a key entangled with the Secure Enclave’s UID and an anti-replay nonce as they are written to the data volume. On A9 (and newer) SoCs, the anti-replay nonce uses entropy generated by the hardware random number generator. The anti-replay nonce support is rooted in a dedicated nonvolatile memory &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/aside/sec3256b5f8c/1/web/1&#34;&gt;integrated circuit (IC)&lt;/a&gt;. In Mac computers with the Apple T2 Security Chip, the FileVault key hierarchy is similarly linked to the UID of the Secure Enclave. In devices with A12 (and newer) and S4 SoCs, the Secure Enclave is paired with a secure storage IC for anti-replay nonce storage. The secure storage IC is designed with immutable ROM code, a hardware random number generator, cryptography engines, and physical tamper detection. To read and update nonces, the Secure Enclave and storage IC employ a secure protocol that ensures exclusive access to the nonces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/dedicated-aes-engine-sec4ea70a303/1/web/1&#34;&gt;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/dedicated-aes-engine-sec4ea70a303/1/web/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this resembles the sad story of a businessman from &lt;em&gt;Eine Woche volle Samstage (1973)&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Maar, when a man was so afraid 😱 of thieves 🦹‍♀️ that he hid the office key 🔑 in a sock 🧦, the sock - in a boot 🥾, the boot in a wardrobe locked with a key, the key to the wardrobe hid in his table&amp;rsquo;s drawer, and the key from the last had lost and by doing so arranged an unscheduled day-off for his employees. So is with the encryption on iOS devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;device_encr_scheme.png&#34; alt=&#34;device_encr_scheme&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File contents&amp;rsquo;s is encrypted with its key, which is stored in the metadata. File key is wrapped with a class key. The metadata, where this encrypted key is stored, is then encrypted by the file system key. All of it is finally protected by an alianz of the user&amp;rsquo;s passcode key and a hardware key (UID). Wow. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive a bit deeper, cause it all seems to be too messed up and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User passcode if fed to RNG. It&amp;rsquo;s also to entangled with UID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;class-keys&#34;&gt;Class keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class key represent protection classes. Each one except of &lt;strong&gt;NSFileProtectionNone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are protected with the alianz of hardware key and user passcode key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete Protection (NSFileProtectionComplete)&lt;/strong&gt; Data is inaccessible until the user unlocks the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected Unless Open (NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen)&lt;/strong&gt;: Data is accessible after the user unlocks the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected Until First User Authentication (NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication)&lt;/strong&gt;: The file can be accessed as soon as the user unlocks the device for the first time after booting. It can be accessed even if the user subsequently locks the device and the class key is not removed from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Protection (NSFileProtectionNone)&lt;/strong&gt;: Protected with the UID only. The class key is stored in &amp;ldquo;Effaceable Storage&amp;rdquo;, which is a region of flash memory on the iOS device that allows the storage of small amounts of data. Used for remote wiping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Secure Enclave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UNeUT_sRos&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UNeUT_sRos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web&#34;&gt;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea behind the scenes is that applications or even OS itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the keys. OS only sees Keychain, but the Security Enclave is separated. It&amp;rsquo;s asked to decrypt the information and it does just that returning the decrypted information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T2 vs T1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Enclave - coprocessor with a Keymanager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices which have the SE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone 5s (or later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad Air (or later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac computers that contain the T1 chip or the Apple T2 Security Chip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple TV 4th generation (or later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Watch Series 1 (or later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HomePod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s observe this scheme from Apple website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;SEP_scheme_Apple.png&#34; alt=&#34;SEP_scheme_Apple&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure Enclave and Application Processor (the main CPU) have separate boot processes and even separate starting code (BootROM) and separate OS. SE has its own light-weight OS (based on L4-family microkernel). And even update process is isolated. With each boot an ephemeral memory protection key is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;boot-process&#34;&gt;Boot process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot ROM (&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ead &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;nly &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;emory) is executed like the Big Bang, out of nowhere. It&amp;rsquo;s called read-only because it can not be changes and therefore is hardware root of trust. It&amp;rsquo;s implicitly trusted. So they say, you know, if you can&amp;rsquo;t trust Boot ROM, whom can you trust then? Than would be a crazy world. Phew! 😅 It&amp;rsquo;s such a relief that ROM can be ultimately trusted. It contains the Apple Root CA 🔖 public key &amp;#x1f511;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot ROM creates a key
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User&amp;rsquo;s key + device&amp;rsquo;s UID = ephemeral memory protection key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, ephemeral memory protection key is used to protect Security Enclave&amp;rsquo;s memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;filevault&#34;&gt;FileVault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;touchid&#34;&gt;TouchID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 - AuthenTec?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tied at the hardware level to A chip. &lt;code&gt;LAContext&lt;/code&gt; and User Presence/ACLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34; data-lang=&#34;swift&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(touchIdIsSet){

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {

&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t enter the passcode at the very beginning. Where does SE get it from during the very first steps of its boot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;low-level-security&#34;&gt;Low Level Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UID&lt;/code&gt; - key that is fused into Application processor. No one know it and can get from the device. Used to encrypt the contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GUID&lt;/code&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UDID&lt;/code&gt; - device identifier. It can be retrived with iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home button - sapfire crystal for scratch resistance. Capacitive touch for detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;application-sandbox&#34;&gt;Application Sandbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two users on iOS: &lt;code&gt;mobile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. When the device is not jailbroken, all applications and processes run by user are in &lt;code&gt;mobile&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s context. Each application is sandboxed and certain policies are implemented (they are called &lt;em&gt;profiles&lt;/em&gt; in iOS). Hence, an application can&amp;rsquo;t access other apps&amp;rsquo; protected resources. This system is called &lt;em&gt;TrustedBSD Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Framework&lt;/em&gt;.  To access other apps&amp;rsquo; resources, entitlements are specified for each application and checked by &lt;code&gt;securityd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;entitlements&#34;&gt;Entitlements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider some Russian &amp;#x1f1f7;&amp;#x1f1fa; &amp;#x1f469; woman willing to travel to Japan &amp;#x1f1ef;&amp;#x1f1f5;, EU &amp;#x1f1ea;&amp;#x1f1fa; and USA &amp;#x1f1fa;&amp;#x1f1f8;.  Since October Revolution in 1917 and WWI it&amp;rsquo;s no longer possible to do it so simply as that. For travelling one needs a visa &amp;#x1f3ab;, and usually each for each country one&amp;rsquo;s planning to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this Russian woman has two visas yet: Shengen and US, but has not aquired Japanese visa. On passport control &amp;#x1f6c2; (&lt;code&gt;securityd&lt;/code&gt;) these visas in her passport are checked and corresponding gates are opened if the visa is present. If not, the access to the country&amp;rsquo;s gate is restricted &amp;#x1f6ab;. Since she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a Japanese visa, she is not &lt;em&gt;entitled&lt;/em&gt; to travel to Japan. Since she has EU and US visas, she can travel there freely. There are, of course, dozens of other people, who can have EU or US visa, so she&amp;rsquo;s not the only one entitled to get there. Basically, they are all in the same &lt;em&gt;entitlement group&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is here: each application has &amp;ldquo;passport&amp;rdquo; &amp;#x1f516; with entitlements (an array of strings), based on which an access is denied &amp;#x1f6ab; or allowed &amp;#x2705; by &amp;#x1f6c2; &lt;code&gt;securityd&lt;/code&gt; (passport control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All entitlements are added before or during signing the application, hence they cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is very well known for its value of security and the advanced security mechanisms. I personally found it hard sometimes to understand specific technical controls. This is why I am writing this little article. Smartphones are known to be more secure than desktops for they are also more MOBILE and tend to get lost a lot. That&amp;rsquo;s why MacBooks tend to get closer and closer to smartphones in terms of security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Electron is a framework that is available for building applications, cross-platform. You’re creating a web-application that can be used as a desktop one (implementing both back- and frontend). Backend - node.js, and frontend - Chrome. So, a lot of artifacts can be shared with Chrome and buddies. It’s in wide use. For example, ⚠️ WhatsApp and Skype use it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow Copies are exactly those pieces of data that get saved on disk when the system restore option is enabled. Once triggered, these files restore the system to the previous state. It&amp;rsquo;s very useful when you are not an expert in PC and something weird is happening. However, not only ordinary people find this feature useful. Some bad guys might try to cover their tracks which can sometimes be undone with this feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Local Stored Objects (LSOs), or Flash Cookies, have become ubiquitous on most systems due to the extremely high penetration of Flash applications across the internet. LSOs allow a web application to store information that can later be accessed by that same application (or domain). They tend to be much more persistent because they do not expire and there is no built-in mechanism within the browser to remove them. In fact, many sites have begun using LSOs for their tracking mechanisms because they rarely get cleared like traditional cookies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*Are we looking for USB storage media activity or all USB devices? Like, cameras 📸? Headphones 🎧? As for the timestamps, you&amp;rsquo;ll usually have &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; (setupapi log) and &lt;strong&gt;last&lt;/strong&gt; connected. There are also OS specific timestamps, like first or last install, first connect since reboot etc. &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/dfir/host/windows/windows-artifacts#usb-devices&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; USB artifacts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/dfir/host/apple/mac-artifacts#usb-devices&#34;&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;❗️These techniques require admin or higher privileges.
❗️Common with ransomware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;Security&lt;/code&gt; trail is deleted, &lt;code&gt;1102&lt;/code&gt; is usually created afterwards. When all other trails are deleted, &lt;code&gt;104&lt;/code&gt; EID is generated in the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event logs are NOT designed to be deleted selectively, all or none. However, some tools are capable of circumventing this and can actually partially clear the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🛠️ &lt;code&gt;Mimikatz&lt;/code&gt; - 📕 &lt;code&gt;event::drop&lt;/code&gt; can stop the event log process from writing &lt;code&gt;Security&lt;/code&gt; events. It can&amp;rsquo;t restart it through, so, obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🛠️ &lt;code&gt;DanderSprite&lt;/code&gt; - (leaked by &lt;code&gt;ShadowBrokers&lt;/code&gt;) change the pointers to the next events in the headers. So, the events are not deleted but are not visible either. Deep dive forensics to help here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🛠️ &lt;code&gt;Invoke-Phant0m&lt;/code&gt; - kill the threads of event logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can also suspend the event log process or make changes in RAM. However, all of these actions require 👑.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;event-logs&#34;&gt;Event logs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring for these events will cause a lot of noise and false positives. You need to do it in a smart way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter for sensitive groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whitelist those processes performing such activity legitimately: &lt;code&gt;mmc.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;services.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;taskhost.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vsssvc.exe&lt;/code&gt;. Presume everything else to be unusual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What accounts are NOT supposed to do recon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What group was queried? &lt;code&gt;Administrators&lt;/code&gt; group (or other groups with higher privileges) is the most desirable piece of the pie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4798&lt;/code&gt; - user&amp;rsquo;s local group membership enum.
&lt;code&gt;4799&lt;/code&gt; - security-enabled local group membership enum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>🤔 How do I check program execution?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/cheatsheets/execution/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Prefetch which is the most reliable source. However, if the program is NOT there, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it wasn&amp;rsquo;t executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another artefact of use is AmCache. What&amp;rsquo;s great about it is that it stores hashes among all. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not proof of the program being executed, it can show the PRESENCE of files (exe and drivers) on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shimcache&#34;&gt;ShimCache&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ok to collect artefacts like that manually, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to do so at scale. Some tools were designed to process these artefacts and put everything in an SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;amcache-registry-&#34;&gt;AmCache, Registry 🗄️&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see firmware, hardware and OS info there. Although the artefact has proved to be highly &amp;ldquo;volatile&amp;rdquo;, it might change from update to update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;macOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lockdown-files&#34;&gt;Lockdown files&lt;/h4&gt;

      <title>🤔 How Do I Find Malicious or Compromised Accounts?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/cheatsheets/account/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/cheatsheets/account/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;event-logs&#34;&gt;Event logs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📂 &lt;code&gt;%system root%\System32\config\SecEvent.evt&lt;/code&gt;
📂 &lt;code&gt;%system root%\System32\winevt\logs\Security.evtx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/acc_created1.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with the event &lt;code&gt;4720&lt;/code&gt; (account created) and multiple &lt;code&gt;4732&lt;/code&gt; events (member added to some security-enabled group). This account must be enabled (&lt;code&gt;4722&lt;/code&gt;) before it can be used. You might see 4738 (account was changed) or even &lt;code&gt;4724&lt;/code&gt; (password reset attempt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✍🏻 &lt;code&gt;4728&lt;/code&gt; - member was added to a security-enabled global group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✍🏻 &lt;code&gt;4732&lt;/code&gt; - member was added to a security-enabled local group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>🤔 How Do I investigate logon events?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/cheatsheets/logon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/cheatsheets/logon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;event-logs&#34;&gt;Event Logs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fine line between logon and &lt;em&gt;account&lt;/em&gt; logon events, and that line is not just one word. The main idea is that logon is the event on the system that wants to chat, whilst account logon is the event on the server/remote system that our computer wants to talk to: user authentication and logon from the Security trail. Event codes &lt;code&gt;4624&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most events are logged on the target machine, but you can also see these events on the source machine. That happens when the user authenticates locally with the credentials from the SAM database (NTLM protocol); you will see EID &lt;code&gt;4776&lt;/code&gt; (NTLM creds used for logon) for both successful and failed logons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>🤔 How Do I Spot Bruteforcing Activity?</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;event-logs&#34;&gt;Event logs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no shortage of &lt;code&gt;4625&lt;/code&gt; events (unsuccessful login) showing up in the logs. Since this attack is most likely happening over the network, the logon type will be &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; (often SMB or RDP). Now, if you give those events a once-over, you will be able to figure out whether we&amp;rsquo;re up against a rather pesky password spray attack or an attack on a single account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To carry out nearly any action on a system, one requires an account, which is typically safeguarded by passwords or other credentials. Hence, it is crucial to understand why attackers exhibit such a strong interest in acquiring them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Init&lt;/code&gt; is the process that spawns other processes and usually has pid &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set run level for the systems. &lt;code&gt;/etc/rc.d&lt;/code&gt; has a collection of files that define what services are running at what level. This information can also be viewed with a &lt;strong&gt;chkconfig&lt;/strong&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;setuid&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;setgid&lt;/code&gt; bits set in UNIX. &lt;code&gt;chmod u+s [file]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;chmod 4777 [file]&lt;/code&gt; to set the bit. To enable the setgid bit, &lt;code&gt;chmod 2775&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chmod g+s&lt;/code&gt; can be used. Look for the files with the bit set: &lt;code&gt;find / -perm +4000 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find / -perm +2000 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;segid&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user runs an executable file with the setuid bit set, the real user ID (RUID) of the process is set to the user ID of the user who ran the file, while the effective user ID (EUID) is set to the user ID of the file owner. This means that the process runs with the privileges of the file owner while still retaining the identity of the user who executed the file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Run a tool to collect all the artefacts for this OS (for example, &lt;code&gt;autorunc.exe&lt;/code&gt; for Windows) on the machines in question. I use CSV format as output whenever possible because it can be imported in a SIEM, TimeLine Explorer (Windows) or Numbers/Excel/Google Sheets. I prefer the last option because its pivoting functionality is much easier to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open each file (if there are not too many)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter for untrusted or missing vendors. Such vendors as Google and Firefox might be used to trick the user. It would look like `(Not verified) Firefox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show those enabled ones (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the image path, and use the FindEvil SANS poster or your baseline system profile as a reference for known good to find what’s bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the hashes and check against known-good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check with a supernova, google Publishes and Description&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency analysis. What stands out? (see the following sections). Find possible suspicious or malicious things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the triage files from other machines for the same IoCs (Select-String, grep etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stacking (frequency-based outlier analysis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency analysis. What stands out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗒 If the file doesn’t have an image path (&lt;code&gt;File not found&lt;/code&gt;), it’s likely it was moved/deleted and thus is not an active threat. What’s suspicious?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lkm&#34;&gt;LKM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LKM for Linux. Drivers are one type of kernel extentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xdg&#34;&gt;XDG&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013/&#34;&gt;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kext&#34;&gt;kext&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kext&lt;/code&gt; for macOS. &lt;code&gt;kextload&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kextunload&lt;/code&gt;. These need to be signed with a cert approved by Apple. Otherwise, to launch the app one needs to disable SIP. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the reason why the RAM cannot be dumped on macOS with SIP enabled. Replaced by System Extentions but still can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reopen&#34;&gt;reopen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the &amp;ldquo;Reopen windows when logging back in&amp;rdquo; prompt on macOS? When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named &lt;code&gt;com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist&lt;/code&gt; within the &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Preferences/ByHost&lt;/code&gt; directory. Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user’s next logon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Token impersonalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;runas&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CreateProcessWithTokenW&lt;/code&gt; to create a process with the rights of another user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spoof parent process ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows. SID-history injection. By injecting a fake SID into the SID history of a user account, an attacker can create a new identity with additional access rights without raising any alarms. 🚨 Need elevated privileges. The SID history is stored in the user object&amp;rsquo;s attribute in the AD database. The attribute is named &amp;ldquo;SIDHistory&amp;rdquo; and can be viewed and modified using the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) management console or other AD management tools.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;login-activity&#34;&gt;Login activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For admin account go to IAM -&amp;gt; Credential report to see all the users and the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arn (acc N + username)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user_creation_time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password_last_used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password_last_changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password_next_rotation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mfa_active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_1_active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_1_last_rotated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_1_last_used_date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_1_last_used_region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_1_last_used_service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_2_active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_2_last_rotated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_2_last_used_date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_2_last_used_region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access_key_2_last_used_service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cert_1_active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cert_1_last_rotated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cert_2_active&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;service-usage-activity&#34;&gt;Service usage activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you can go to IAM -&amp;gt; username -&amp;gt; Access Advisor tab to see the services that this user has access to and when these were last used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are several types of IAM identities. They are usually called &amp;ldquo;Principal&amp;rdquo;. This can be either a User or a Role. It can even be a service or an account. Users can assume Roles. Instance Profile is basically a separate IAM Role assumed by this particular instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM role&lt;/strong&gt;. Some entity (principal in AWS language) that can be assumed by others (users, services, instances, accounts). However assumes the role, is provided with temporary credentials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 7-10 taskbar (Jump List) is engineered to allow users to “jump” or access items they have frequently or recently used quickly and easily. This functionality not only includes recent media files; it must also include recent tasks. The data stored in the AutomaticDestinations folder will each have a unique file prepended with the AppID of the associated application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Mac OS &lt;code&gt;netstat&lt;/code&gt; there is no &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; switch, so I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;code&gt;netstat -ban&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo lsof -i -n -p
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsof -i :443&lt;/code&gt; will show you all connections associated with port 443, commonly used for TLS communication. Sheward, Mike. Hands-on Incident Response and Digital Forensics (p. 163). BCS Learning &amp;amp; Development Limited. Kindle Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;artefacts/apple/connections/images/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;img1&#34;&gt;
The first column will give a hint about what the application responsible for this connection is. To get the full path to the app executable, use &lt;code&gt;ps -fp &amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Host-based IDS look for local system configurations and behaviour, while network-based IDS look for network connections and looks for anomalies and common signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDS and IPS as firewall&amp;rsquo;s filters. There are Control Plane (looks after the OS and routing table) and the Forwarding Plane (makes decisions on routing and discarding). If something happens to the Control Plane, the device will still forward the traffic (really???).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default IDS only &lt;strong&gt;listens 👂&lt;/strong&gt; the traffic. It&amp;rsquo;s usually connected to the span port on a switch. Looks for anomalies and sends alerts. Won&amp;rsquo;t take any actions by default, but can be configured in such a way. If the IDS is down, nothing is changed for the rest of the network, it&amp;rsquo;s still operating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lnk&#34;&gt;LNK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several artifacts indicating user activity. One of them is &lt;code&gt;LNK&lt;/code&gt; files. To analyse acquired LNK files use 🛠 &lt;a href=&#34;https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md&#34;&gt;LECmd&lt;/a&gt; (E. Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s) or &lt;a href=&#34;https://4discovery.com/our-tools/link-parser/&#34;&gt;Link Parser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prefetch&#34;&gt;Prefetch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enother mechanism is Prefetch. It&amp;rsquo;s usually located at &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\Prefetch&lt;/code&gt;. Several tools are available for viewing this artifact: Magnet AXIOM 💰, PECmd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recent-files&#34;&gt;Recent Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent files (LNK) - &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\veronicazvereva\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent Files\&lt;/code&gt; on Windows 11, &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\veronicazvereva\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent&lt;/code&gt; Windows 10-. Captures the MAC times of the original file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This key will track the order of the last 150 files or folders opened, keeping track of the temporal order in which each file/folder was opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗝️ &lt;code&gt;.XXX&lt;/code&gt; - This subkey stores the last files with a specific extension that were opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗝️ &lt;code&gt;Folder&lt;/code&gt; This subkey stores the last folders that were opened. The MRU list will keep track of the temporal order in which each folder was opened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, all console data is not being logged. Only staff that was typed with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; is. Below is the screenshot of the Console app (streaming on) when &lt;code&gt;sudo ls&lt;/code&gt; command is typed in the Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sudo-console.png&#34; alt=&#34;sudo-console&#34;&gt;
And here is what&amp;rsquo;s being logged when one types &lt;code&gt;sudo su&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sudo-console-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;sudo-console-2&#34;&gt;
What about using &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; without elevating privileges? Nothing is logged at all (trying &lt;code&gt;helloworld&lt;/code&gt;, cat &lt;code&gt;metadata.db&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;visudo&lt;/code&gt;). So, how one keeps logging their Terminal history? It would be also great to add PID of the process, effective and real usernames. Here is how I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do it on my local machine (to further integrate the logs with Elastic).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cmd&#34;&gt;CMD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batch script. Highly limited in functionality and caching all sorts of crap, including credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;anatomy&#34;&gt;Anatomy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic is encrypted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerberos is used for authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credentials are not cached on the remote system (not AS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell gives you the power of WMI, .NET and COM at once. It provides a unified interface to interact with data types such as the registry, file volumes, Active Directory etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;❗️The output of most of the ps commands are not strings but objects that can be piped into other commands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to retrieve this information manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ipconfig /displaydns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Win32_DnsCache&lt;/code&gt; from WMI repo (use Kansa to collect and stack this data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yet another place to check for program execution. It&amp;rsquo;s like a forensic treasure of program execution. You can see installed applications, drivers and unassociated progs. For each entry, you can see loads of metadata. You can even see the SHA1 hashes! How great is that? However, be careful; installed doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean executed!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt; command of adb is used to get system log.

Samsung Duo, Android 7, rooted) here I saw the latest records of &lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt;, however the buffer contained a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;syslog&#34;&gt;Syslog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;syslog&lt;/strong&gt;. Since macOS Sierra (10.12, 2016) Apple has redesigned its log system. Unix logs were replaced (syslog, for example). By the way, &lt;code&gt;syslog&lt;/code&gt; was replaced as well on iOS (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/dfir/host/mobile/ios/ios-logs&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Some still exist: &lt;code&gt;daily.out&lt;/code&gt;, cups, &lt;code&gt;install.log&lt;/code&gt;. 🛑 More about logs for iOS and macOS here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🛑 More about fervents here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New unified log path in 2 directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var/db/diagnistics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var/db/uuidtext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging&#34;&gt;Apple docs&lt;/a&gt;, NSLog now doesn&amp;rsquo;t write to syslog, therefore I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a &lt;code&gt;syslog.sock&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;syslog&lt;/code&gt; file itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A named pipe is not exactly the same as a reverse shell, but it can be used in a similar way to establish a remote connection between two systems. A named pipe is a type of inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that allows two or more processes to communicate with each other on a local computer or over a network. A named pipe has a name and is implemented as a file object. Processes can read from and write to the named pipe as if it were a regular file. Named pipes are commonly used in client-server applications, where a server process creates a named pipe and waits for client processes to connect to it. Once a client connects to the named pipe, the server can send and receive data to and from the client. ChatGPT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RDP Bitmap Cache. Windows developed RDP—small chunks of screenshots. The size of each is &lt;code&gt;64x64&lt;/code&gt; bit. And also, there is 1 huge sprite with all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;USERPROFILE&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;older - &lt;code&gt;.bmc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;newer - &lt;code&gt;Cache####.bin&lt;/code&gt; where # is a number starting from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you investigate a successful RDP login to a specific machine, note that only in the case of the RDP login the “Workstation Name” field in the “Network Information” section does not refer to the source machine name instead it refers to the name of the machine that recorded the event log (Target machine). be careful because such wrong information may miss leading your incident investigations. For the example in the screenshot, the “pbeesly” account logged on the “SCARNTON” hostname from the &lt;code&gt;172.18.39.2&lt;/code&gt; source machine IP. If you want to find the source machine name you can use the Event IDs 4778 or 4779 recorded in the security events instead. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mostafa-yahia-701b4b15a_in-case-you-investigate-a-successful-rdp-activity-7004505487912112130-W6Oo?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&#34;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mostafa-yahia-701b4b15a_in-case-you-investigate-a-successful-rdp-activity-7004505487912112130-W6Oo?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To open a file, one needs to perform a delightful jaunt to a directory where those files reside. Now picture this: imagine if we could keep a journal of all the full paths of the folders visited; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be splendid? It so happens that this nice functionality does exist on Windows machines and ShellBags they are called. Since these folders can be located on a remote machine, a USB drive or any other external media, this artefact can be used to make assumptions about remote connections and devices attached.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How often has the following happened to you? You want to run a program, but it&amp;rsquo;s not designed to run on this version of OS. Windows has a mechanism to run older programs on newer systems. Even when these &amp;ldquo;compatibility&amp;rdquo; adjustments are not required, Windows still logs the information for all the programs run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several formats that logs can exist in depending on the system in question and configurations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W3C. ASCII, UTC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIS. ASCII, local time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCSA. ASCII, no customization, local time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIS ODBC. Needs to be enabled first, degrades performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BIN. IIS 5.1+, in binary format, logging several websites at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML. Mostly used for applications to share data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;access.log&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Using pivot tables may help. Apache has an &lt;code&gt;access.log&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every day, the computer loads some programs and a lot of additional crap that comes with it. Every day the same routine over and over again. Being a diligent and responsible guy, it wondered how to improve this process. So, it decides to save the most recently loaded programs and whatever dlls and stuff these programs need so that everything is ready the next time the program is run. Where is this data stored? In Prefetch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*Memory is the best evidence, although the hardest to preserve. If you recall Frozen II, &amp;ldquo;Water has memory&amp;rdquo; - same story. Even if you delete all the evidence, memory silently remembers all that. But it&amp;rsquo;s so fragile&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is particularly tiresome to reverse. Some advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set calling convention for fastcall if it&amp;rsquo;s not set properly (IDA Pro doesn&amp;rsquo;t, not sure about radare2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delphi programs have a lot of structures.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is about use-after-free vulnerability, its mechanics and how it can be used for evil things. Several things could be done by using this vulnerability, for example, reading sensitive info or arbitrary code execution. The exploitation often requires the presence of some other vulnerability as well, for example, buffer overflow (not always).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

unlike what others said, it does matter! and as @einstein if you care use &lt;code&gt;HMAC&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why prefix is bad, because one can calculate the intermediate state of the checksum up to the given fixed salt prefix. then start calculating the rest in parallel. In summary &lt;code&gt;phrase+salt&lt;/code&gt; is more secure than &lt;code&gt;salt+phrase&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;HMAC(salt, phrase)&lt;/code&gt; is even better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First of all, data that is collected for analysis within the cloud needs to be handled properly as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*## Logical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zero-n-bits-out&#34;&gt;Zero &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; bits out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do, is to &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; it with a &lt;code&gt;0000 0000&lt;/code&gt; mask (for a one byte value in this example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-if-an-integer-is-even&#34;&gt;Check if an integer is even&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mask it with &lt;code&gt;0000 0001&lt;/code&gt;. Even numbers have &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; at the end, and uneven - &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;ing an even number with &lt;code&gt;0000 0001&lt;/code&gt; will result in &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;ing an uneven - with &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bit-map&#34;&gt;Bit map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND operation will be used to check if the given bit in the bit map was set already: &lt;code&gt;if bit_vector &amp;amp; (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; char_code)&lt;/code&gt;. 1 &amp;laquo; char_code basically does the following (using 8 bit value for simplicity). Say, we checking if either of the numbers appeared more than once in some data (numbers from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FAT Data Recovery</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/data-recovery/file-systems/fat/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/data-recovery/file-systems/fat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;fat32-file-recovery&#34;&gt;FAT32 File Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get familiar with the FAT file system. There are some things specific to this FS in the way the files are created and deleted. We basically need to follow the file deletion steps in the reversed order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Change &lt;code&gt;0xE5&lt;/code&gt; values in the directory entry set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Change FAT table values to indicate allocated (not &lt;code&gt;0x00000000&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Use the short file name directory entry (starting cluster and file size)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Determine the cluster size using the volume boot record data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Calculate the number of clusters needed (&lt;code&gt;int clusters = file_size / cluster_size&lt;/code&gt;). Keep in mind, that file size for folders is always &lt;code&gt;00 00 00 00&lt;/code&gt;. So, don&amp;rsquo;t confuse a file with a folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Rechain FAT entries of the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔎 Intrestingly enough, this method worked on a FAT32 formatted flash drive. Why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Host-based IDP/IPS</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/ids-ips/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Host-based IDS look for local system configurations and behaviour, while network-based IDS look for network connections and looks for anomalies and common signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDS and IPS as firewall&amp;rsquo;s filters. There are Control Plane (looks after the OS and routing table) and the Forwarding Plane (makes decisions on routing and discarding). If something happens to the Control Plane, the device will still forward the traffic (really???).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default IDS only &lt;strong&gt;listens 👂&lt;/strong&gt; the traffic. It&amp;rsquo;s usually connected to the span port on a switch. Looks for anomalies and sends alerts. Won&amp;rsquo;t take any actions by default, but can be configured in such a way. If the IDS is down, nothing is changed for the rest of the network, it&amp;rsquo;s still operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPS takes actions on its own. It is not connected to the span port, but rather is a gateway. Before it inspects and allows a packet through, nothing can move forward. So, if IPS is down, everyone is down (unless there is some load balancing enabled or may be some policy for such cases). Positioned right after the router, edge device or a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malware analysis should always be done with caution. Also, in order to trick the most sophisticated malware into executing, one needs to make it believable that malware is on a real host.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several years ago, the internet was flooded with news about two famous vulnerabilities: Meltdown and Spectre. It took me some time to understand how both of them work, but here are the results of my attempt. To understand the mechanics of these two vulnerabilities, one needs to understand the basics that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to explain in the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://bakerst221b.com/docs/reverse/basics/cpu&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;traceroute-tracert&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tracert&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;tracert&lt;/code&gt; (due to some legacy max-name-size limitations). On Linux and macOS - &lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;. Windows uses ICMP protocol by default, while macOS and Linux - &lt;code&gt;UDP&lt;/code&gt;. You can, however, make &lt;code&gt;tracerout&lt;/code&gt; on UNIX operate over ICMP by specifying &lt;code&gt;-I&lt;/code&gt; switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🧪 There is an extraordinary thing that I have noticed. I was trying to capture the traceroute and tracert traffic to show the screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I launched traceroute on macOS, and I got a bizarre response: 64 lines of 3 wildcards that could indicate a firewall blocking ICMP/UDP requests. I googled and googled and decided to check the Windows tracert on a VM on the same machine. And strangely, I got a normal response. That led me to believe that the macOS traceroute is buggy since the machine is the same and all traffic is routed through the same nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NTFS Data Recovery</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/data-recovery/file-systems/ntfs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/data-recovery/file-systems/ntfs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get familiar with NTFS file creation and deletion, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/dfir/data-storage/file-systems/ntfs#file-creation-and-deletion&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In general, there are resident and non-resident files. Resident files are small and have their contents in the MFT record itself. Non-resident files are bigger and their contents is stored elsewhere on the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Since MFT records get reused once they are deallocated on the first-free basis, resident files get overwritten sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resident files, use a regular expression for finding &lt;code&gt;FILE0&lt;/code&gt; records: &lt;code&gt;\x46\x49\x4C\x45.{18}[\x00\x02]&lt;/code&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/windows-os-forensics/lecture/VMUiU/ntfs-file-recovery&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. This will find all the &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; records that are not newly created. Remember, once a file is created its sequence number is &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever the &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; record is deleted (deallocated, it&amp;rsquo;s never actually deleted), the sequence number gets incremented. So, if this record was deallocated once, its sequence number will be &lt;code&gt;0x02&lt;/code&gt;. But! This record can be reused multiple times! When I did the lab, one poor record was reused over and over again, and its sequence number got as big as &lt;code&gt;0x08&lt;/code&gt;, imagine that! So, I would fix the regular expression above to address these cases: &lt;code&gt;\x46\x49\x4C\x45.{18}^[\x00\x01]&lt;/code&gt; (todo).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;macros&#34;&gt;Macros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; at the end of extension means that doc has some macros inside. Not always when there is some macros inside, the doc has a different extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;oleid &amp;lt;docname&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# see info about a file &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;oleobj &amp;lt;docname&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;oledump.py -s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; --vbadecompresscorrupt report.docm
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;olevba &amp;lt;docname&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# get the macro from the doc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;templates&#34;&gt;Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to get naughty for an office doc is to use remote templates. You can see many legit templates in Word GUI when you open the program (without opening any file). Open &lt;code&gt;_rels&lt;/code&gt; folder, &lt;code&gt;settings.xml.rels&lt;/code&gt; file, and check the &lt;code&gt;Relationship&lt;/code&gt; tag and &lt;code&gt;Target&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Check out the link to decide if this is malware. More &lt;a href=&#34;https://pentestlab.blog/2019/12/11/persistence-office-application-startup/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several techniques for port scanning. Some of them work for one OS only.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The CanRestart option being true, allows us to restart a service on the system, the directory to the application is also write-able. This means we can replace the legitimate application with our malicious one, restart the service, which will run our infected program!
Note: The service showed up as being unquoted (and could be exploited using this technique), however, in this case we have exploited weak file permissions on the service files instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Say, for example, that some utility has this bit set. That means that the utility has elevated permissions. You might get lucky; check the executable with strings for some commands. If you see some system utility without a full path, you can create a script in the same location and it will be run instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viginear cypher is more sophisticated than the Caesar cypher. Since the key is several characters long and the length is unknown, the frequency analysis technique becomes more challenging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moving accounts and auth policies to the server side. Azure Active Directory is when instead of having a physical server, you have a server in the cloud ⛅️. Defines a set of rules to restrict users&amp;rsquo; access to resources. PCs that are part of AD usually don&amp;rsquo;t have full access to the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AD DS store contains db files and processes that manage directory information for users, services and applications. Consists of &lt;code&gt;Ntds.dit&lt;/code&gt; file, at &lt;code&gt;%SystemRoot%\	NTDS&lt;/code&gt; folder on all DC. Is only accessible thtough the DC&amp;rsquo;s processes and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey, ps! Would like you to hear a fairy tale? I am sure that you do! It all happened not long long time ago and not in a galaxy far far away&amp;hellip; . Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that in the J.Rowling&amp;rsquo;s universe there were cybersecurity specialists as well and Hogwarts had a real website in the Internet. Funky idea! 💡&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very hard-working girl, let&amp;rsquo;s call her Rachel (yeah, Rachel 😉) was sitting at her table, working as usual when she suddenly saw her phone vibrating nearby. She picked up the phone, hoping that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a spam. Indeed it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. That was her colleague, asking if she is interested in a little side project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;🕰 &lt;code&gt;11:21 AM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cloudy Sunday morning. I was sleeping peacefully till 8:45 AM when my daughter started crawling all over me and my husband asking wether I am awake already&amp;hellip; . Well, now I am, darling, many thanks 🤦🏻‍♀️! After having a delicious breakfast (eggplants with home-made tomato sauce, yummy 😋) and getting the kitchen back to the clean state (it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to keep it that way), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to finally repair my little old fellow iPhone 7. Several weeks ago I went on vocation to Cyprus and broke the rare camera glass and the screen as well, because I somehow managed to drop the phone on the pavement 3 ❗️times! To be honest, these were not the first times when my iPhone met some surface harder than my palm, so it&amp;rsquo;s a miracle this had not happened before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was a very sunny day and a very nice a long walk that my daughter and I had before lunch. I feel uplifted because there is finally enough sun and green grass in my life! Unfortunately, no coffee today, since we don&amp;rsquo;t have BonAcqua, which might be not the best for drinking, but is indeed one of the best to prepare coffee (quoting my husband).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had a 7-day license of Magnet AXIOM and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try this tool and compare it with others that I had. In 2021 May-June Magnet held a great event of a great value - Magnet SUMMIT with lots of very useful webinars and workshops. One of them was a case study using Magnet. I am going to follow these steps and study another way to solve a crime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;☀️ &lt;em&gt;It was a very deceptively sunny morning, children laughing and squeaking merrily. When I closed my eyes I could almoust believe it was late spring or summer&amp;hellip;. And the soul was filling with joy and inspiration. But unfortunately the temperature was too low (-10 ❄️ ⛄️  if you believe Yandex) and going for a outside-working-day was impossible 😔.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am finishing my cup of coffee ☕️ , my husband working in the adjacent room and my daughter playing with her new toys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Got Started With AWS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this blog post I am exploring AWS services (EC2). I am currently using a Free Tier license and I am trying to learn how to use. Why? Well, knowing AWS seems to be a very useful skill on the market. And the second reason for that is that I used to have different VMs that cosumed too much memory (HDD and RAM). Now I am also using M1 MacBook Pro and that&amp;rsquo;s why having so many VMs locally is impossible since there are only some Linux and Windows 10 Machines available for ARM platform. Besides, I&amp;rsquo;ve notices that I don&amp;rsquo;t really use them much so having 60 GB of space occupied for occasional usage is weird. Everything speaks in the favour of AWS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One late evening when my eyes were so difficult to keep open, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to setup a Windows Lab on my M1 Mac. Long story short, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make Autopsy work as expected and that&amp;rsquo;s why I had to waste my time on this task&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x1f4c6; &lt;code&gt;01/03/2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x23f0; &lt;code&gt;22:17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I had to sign up to Microsoft Insider Program &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64?wa=wsignin1.0&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It was free and I signed up. Then, I&amp;rsquo;ve installed Parallels from &lt;a href=&#34;https://b2b.parallels.com/apple-silicon&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; using &amp;ldquo;Try technical preview&amp;rdquo; option that was available at this point in time. Also, at this point of time a free activation key &amp;#x1f511; was available for Parallels (thank you 🙏 so much, guys, for this) &lt;a href=&#34;https://my.parallels.com/desktop/beta?_ga=2.154508411.2118090463.1614625046-817269375.1614625046&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. During installation process I was a little bewildered by the question about the use purpose of this software&amp;hellip; Gaming or ordinary use (text editing, web-browsing etc). I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen &amp;ldquo;Gaming&amp;rdquo; since I presume Autopsy and software alike do consume much power. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this option changes the performance or it&amp;rsquo;s rather some survey. Anyway. After all that everything worked like a charm. But I still have not tried installing autopsy&amp;hellip; So, let&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been longing to finish Hacking the Art of Exploitation book, but I needed VM for that and this wasn&amp;rsquo;t very convenient. But recently I&amp;rsquo;ve set my EC2 AWS environment and am going to use VMs remotely. This makes it easier to finally finish the book 📚.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to solve a puzzle per week just to keep myself &amp;ldquo;forensically fit&amp;rdquo;. This is my case study of Dr.Evil case (spoiler alert &amp;#x26a0;&amp;#xfe0f;). If you wish to solve it yourself, don&amp;rsquo;t read this blog post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-objectives&#34;&gt;Case Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;09/20/04&lt;/code&gt; , a Dell CPi notebook computer, serial # &lt;code&gt;VLQLW&lt;/code&gt;, was found abandoned along with a wireless PCMCIA card and an external homemade 802.11b antennae. It is suspected that this computer was used for hacking purposes, although cannot be tied to a hacking suspect, G=r=e=g S=c=h=a=r=d=t. (The equal signs are just to prevent web crawlers from indexing this name; there are no equal signs in the image files.) &lt;code&gt;Schardt&lt;/code&gt; also goes by the online nickname of &lt;code&gt;“Mr. Evil”&lt;/code&gt; and some of his associates have said that he would park his vehicle within range of Wireless Access Points (like Starbucks and other T-Mobile Hotspots) where he would then intercept internet traffic, attempting to get credit card numbers, usernames &amp;amp; passwords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>📚 Ethernet</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/dlink/ethernet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2020 13:55:56 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/dlink/ethernet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;arp-protocol&#34;&gt;ARP Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a protocol of a data link layer of TCP/IP stack. It&amp;rsquo;s not on any layer per se. However, I&amp;rsquo;m putting this paragraph here because ARP is needed for filling in Ethernet header details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attacks&#34;&gt;Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAM (Content Addressable Memory) - switch keeps a record of all MACs of connected devices and their assigned virtual ports on that switch in a table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;MAC&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Switch port&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1111:1111:0000:2222&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flooding-with-1-mac&#34;&gt;Flooding with 1 MAC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send lots of ARP reply to constantly update 1 entry (race condition). Whenever the MAC in CAM table is substututed with the attacker&amp;rsquo;s MAC, the responses will be redirected to the attacker. As soon as the victim sends a new request to some server through the switch, its MAC overwrites the attacker&amp;rsquo;s. So it looks like a battle for 1 &amp;ldquo;seat&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;omain &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;ame &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ystem. Translates IPs to domain names like &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;router.lan&lt;/code&gt; and visa versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS querying can be either recursive or non-recursive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recursive&lt;/strong&gt;. ISP DNS server queries other DNS servers until it finds the answer. Once it&amp;rsquo;s found, it&amp;rsquo;s returned by the ISP DNS to the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-recursive&lt;/strong&gt;. ISP DNS is not involved? Response comes directly from the DNS server queried the last. So, who has asked initially, would be shown in the last DNS server&amp;rsquo;s logs 📝.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;System design is very important for any IT specialist. Software engineers are not the only ones who get frequently asked about this when interviewed in some top IT companies. Security engineers face this kind of questions as well. Here are my notes and ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve made about system design. I had no prior knowledge whatsoever when I started learning this. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure what kind of problems I am to expect for a security position. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover some courses to get the idea and try to come up with my own system design interview questions and how to answer them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>📚 SSL and TLS</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/asp/crypto/ssl-tls/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article explains how SSL and its successsor work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSL makes use of assymmetric encryption for verification and symmetric encryption for data exchanging. Common ports: &lt;code&gt;443&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes &lt;code&gt;5443&lt;/code&gt;. TLS is an improvement. SSL is not being used too much since it&amp;rsquo;s not very secure (exploiting it requires a lot of knowledge and effort though), however, the protocol scheme is still called SSL/TLS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written this article while I was untanging RSA and Deffie Hellman inside my head. What I need to stree right here, in the article description, the main difference between them is the Deffie Hellman is NOT a encryption algorithm! It&amp;rsquo;s an algorithm of generating a symmetric key using principles of asymmetric cryptography.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the mathmatics topics needed to understand this algorothm, please, refer to the math sections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To my utter embarrassment I had to admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember how the RSA worked&amp;hellip;. What I though to be RSA turned out to be Diffie-Hellman algorithm&amp;hellip; Oops &amp;#x1f62c;. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve rewatched Khan&amp;rsquo;s video about RSA and was surprised I could every confuse the two. This article and another one about Diffie-Hellman is my way of explaining cryptographic notions: visual representation, verbal explanation and&amp;hellip; code.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;apfs&#34;&gt;APFS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APM and APFS seem to be unable to live together. APFS requires GUID. I have come to that conclusion when I tried formating the drive with a APM and then APFS with DiskUtility. The same goes for the MBR. APFS &lt;strong&gt;requires&lt;/strong&gt; GPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Apple-File-System-Reference.pdf&#34;&gt;https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Apple-File-System-Reference.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages over HFS+&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimized for Flash/SSD Storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disk encryption is &lt;em&gt;natively&lt;/em&gt; supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapshot support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timestamps are to-the-nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 quintillion files at most (18 zeroes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clones (aka copy-on-write). When the file is copied, it&amp;rsquo;s actually not duplicated. Instead, a new pointer is created. Once either of the files get changed, the actual copying process takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Is used to safe memory. For example, number 5 only occupies 1 byte, but 1032 will need two bytes to live. They are also little-endian values. But how to tell when the number ends? Easy, the most significant bit of every byte (byte being the smallest space occupied) tells the PC whether there are more bytes to come. So, for example, the following is the number &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, just five, no caveats:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/artefacts/fs/fat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any FAT partition has two main parts: system area and data area. System area contains FAT boot record (every file system has a boot record), 1st FAT and 2nd FAT. FAT12 and FAT16 also have Root directory in the system area. Data area consists of Root directory in case of FAT32 and file and subdirectory data in clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;versions&#34;&gt;Versions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fat12&#34;&gt;FAT12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the cluster addressing there were 12 bits available, which is 2^12 clusters at most (4096 clusters).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hfs-1&#34;&gt;HFS+&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1998, since macOS 8.1. Was replaced by APFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;natively&lt;/em&gt; support full disk encryption (FV2 was added later). Timestamps were only to-the-second. Support up to 4 billion files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports large files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient disk space usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unicode for filenames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name forks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;journaling. Journaling is a mechanism in which changes to a disk are first committed to a journal file, which acts as a buffer to ensure that all disk update transactions are fully completed. &lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dynamic resizing, defragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed in collaboration with IBM. POSIX compliant. Official docs for NTFS &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntfs.com/ntfs-mft.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;❗️ Everything is a file!
❗️ All offsets are relative to the start of the data structures.
❗️ Apple macOS machines can read NTFS devices but do not support writing to them by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire logical volume is a data area (in contrast to FAT where there is a system area as well ❓).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Microsoft NT File System (NTFS), hot fixing of disk sectors &lt;strong&gt;prevents data from being stored in a bad sector or cluster&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Partitioning is the address range where the volume with a file system can sit. You create a partition, then you format it to create a volume with a file system. So, &lt;em&gt;partition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt; are not interchangable terms. Usually, a volume occupies the whole partition, but that&amp;rsquo;s not always the case. Sometimes, some little address sapce might be left out of the volume, so that this volume would not occupy the whole partition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-special-files&#34;&gt;Character Special Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the examples of a special files are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/stdin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/stdout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/random&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pseudo-random.htm&#34;&gt;PRNG&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;strong&gt;may delay returning a value to acquire additional entropy&lt;/strong&gt;.) That is why when I &lt;code&gt;cat /dev/random&lt;/code&gt; and do nothing else, it just prints the values, but when I start moving the mouse or turning on a movie - it&amp;rsquo;s hanging for a while.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>SSH Access Setup Explained</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/tools/ssh/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to perform actions with you public/private key pair (git, ssh access), you&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure it first. I found it quite hard to grasp at first with all the nuances, although it&amp;rsquo;s pretty straitforward if you just copy/paste the commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take GitHub and its &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent&#34;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; in order to understand what we are doing and why. This will help in thoubleshooting later if we need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use private/public keys, you will need to generate a pair first. All these keys on macOS and Linux machines are stored at &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/code&gt; by default (hidden folder). Public keys have &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; at the end, private have the same name but no &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; extension. For example, a public key file would be named something like &lt;code&gt;id_rsa.pub&lt;/code&gt;, unless you give it a different name and its corresponding private key would be called just &lt;code&gt;id_rsa&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article I am describing the difference between a process, thread and mutex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When and exe file or other executable file is run, some memory in RAM is allocated and the program&amp;rsquo;s code and data is read from the hard drive and written into RAM. While it&amp;rsquo;s being run, this program exists in two states: in volatile and non-volatile memory. This &amp;ldquo;container&amp;rdquo; is called a process and can be seen using such tools as &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/toolkit/general/reverse-toolkit/#process-explorer&#34;&gt;Process Explorer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/toolkit/general/reverse-toolkit/#process-hacker&#34;&gt;Process Hacker&lt;/a&gt;. Each process manages its resources (handles, memory). If you ran the same program twice, and two processes will be created, the will have different physical addresses but the same virtual addresses (more on that in another article).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Forged Image Detection</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/antiforensics/forged-images/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:50:01 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/antiforensics/forged-images/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier&#34;&gt;https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images can be forged or cloned. Regions can be manipulated with. Hard to detect with naked eye. &amp;#x2757; Social Media strips-off metadata from uploaded images which makes tracking of the image difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main goals are: detect whether the image was cloned and track the source of the image. Forensically and JPEGSnoop open-source tools.  They detect tampering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnification&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Autocontrast&lt;/code&gt; will not disturb the colors too much. &lt;code&gt;Autocontrast by channel&lt;/code&gt; will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clone Detection&lt;/strong&gt;. The most important. &lt;code&gt;Minimal similariyt&lt;/code&gt; ~ &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Minimal detail&lt;/code&gt; ~ &lt;code&gt;0.1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Minimal cluster size&lt;/code&gt; - the number of blocks that two regions need to share in order to be considered clones ~ &lt;code&gt;14&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error-level analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Tells that something was compressed multiple times. For example, when you paste an image on another image and save, the are several compressions in place: for the original image and for the pasted one. Use noise to determine that. Spot the artifacts that have been implanted on an image by compressing it multiple times. Because of the noise these parts can&amp;rsquo;t be compressed much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPEG analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Computes the Quantization table, which specify the way an image has been compressed. Each cell &lt;code&gt;0-255&lt;/code&gt;.  To compress an image the pixel intestines are modified by the software app in the range of &lt;code&gt;-128&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;127&lt;/code&gt; and new quantization table is calculated. The value of standart - &lt;code&gt;95&lt;/code&gt;, which is auto value when the image is not processed. Adobe (Photoshop quality) uses &lt;code&gt;85&lt;/code&gt;. The order of different sections. &lt;code&gt;SOI&lt;/code&gt; - image start,  &lt;code&gt;EOI&lt;/code&gt;- end of image. Multiple &lt;code&gt;SOI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EOI&lt;/code&gt; are indicative of pasting other images. Application segments, &lt;code&gt;APP0&lt;/code&gt;(JPEG version, screen and printing resolution), &lt;code&gt;APP1&lt;/code&gt; (date/time, focal length, aperture), &lt;code&gt;APP13&lt;/code&gt; (if processed with Adobe Photoshop). &lt;code&gt;SOS&lt;/code&gt; - image was compressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural and String Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. When there is no EXIF is useful. &lt;code&gt;FBMD01000a9...&lt;/code&gt; indicated web upload (Facebook).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently have had a severe poisoning (I only hope it&amp;rsquo;s not the rotavirus &amp;#x1f628;) and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent one evening and one day barely moving. Even now, almost two days have passed, but I still feel a little nauseous. But I&amp;rsquo;m not that bad enough now to refresh and learn some assembly (it&amp;rsquo;s always a good medicine for the wicked &amp;#x1f638;). The following chain of thoughts was cut from &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/articles/fundamentals/reveng/assembly-operations&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article once the critical mass of text for &lt;code&gt;SHL/SHR&lt;/code&gt; has exceeded its maximum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During forensic analysis it&amp;rsquo;s not too rare to run into some suspicious application. In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn to reverse engineer iOS applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-flow&#34;&gt;Analysis flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to get IPA file from the device. There are different ways to do so (please, refer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/toolkit/mobile/ios-btfm-rtfm&#34;&gt;BTFM and RTFM&lt;/a&gt;). Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the easiest one:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🎁 Packed Executables And Unpacking</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/malware/analyse/packing/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 10:31:32 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/malware/analyse/packing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several indicators that the executable is packed. Here they are (this list will be growing as I encounter new indicators):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few imports and among these imports are functions like &lt;code&gt;GetProcessAddress&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weird names for PE sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty Physical addresses for sections (while VA is not empty). More about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unpacking-techniques&#34;&gt;Unpacking techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piece of software cannot just run packed (what a challenging world that would be! 😳 ). The thing is that whatever the packing algorithm is, however complex 🧶 it might be, the real code needs to be &lt;em&gt;unpacked into memory&lt;/em&gt; first. So, even with the most sophisticated protection techniques, it all really comes down to waiting for the executable to get unpacked into memory, from where it can be gently and dearly dumped like a 🐝 hive from a tree 🌳 full of hungry and pretty aggressive wild bees with a big and heavy bat 🏃‍♀️. We might want to do some minor other stuff afterwards but let&amp;rsquo;s keep it for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then open the Bundle folder on PC and look for &lt;code&gt;Info.plist&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s find any strings that start with &lt;code&gt;NS&lt;/code&gt; and end with &lt;code&gt;UsageDescription&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Block Ciphers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/cryptography/symmetric/block/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:26:39 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/cryptography/symmetric/block/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the next generation. 128-bit blocks, 128,192, 256 keys. It takes too much time to brute force. However, there are some situations when this could be cracked. And not only ECB but CBC as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One block of plaintext results in a 2-block cypher (random string + cypher text) for some modes. That&amp;rsquo;s why different modes exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synchronised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unsynchronised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CTR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Choose some random string of length N (call it a 🐊)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Do something with the string to get a key 🗝 from 🐊&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; XOR your message 🍆 with a key 🗝&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Cypher text 🫐 = 🐊, 🍆 XOR 🗝&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decryption steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m dissecting a very well-known (and that&amp;rsquo;s why not advisable to be used) cryptographic algorithm which is better known for IT tribe as &amp;ldquo;ROT13&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DES&lt;/strong&gt; - Symmetric. &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;ata &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;ncryption &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;tandard. NIST 1993. 56 bit key, 64-bit plaintext input (blocks). How secure? Can be brute-forced in 4 months. No known &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; decryption approach. To make it more secure, change keys every 3 months, use 3 keys, use cipher-block chaining.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One-time Pad</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/cryptography/symmetric/onetime/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:26:39 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/cryptography/symmetric/onetime/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-time pad is like a Viginear cypher but with the key the length of the cypher text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algo-intro&#34;&gt;Algo Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key requirement for this cypher scheme to be perfectly secret is that the key should only be used once. Why? For example, the same key was applied to two cypher texts (c1 and c2), so that &lt;code&gt;c1 = message1 XOR key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c2 = message2 XOR key&lt;/code&gt;. What can we do here? We can eliminate the key by &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;-ing c1 and c2: &lt;code&gt;c1 XOR c2 = (message1 XOR key) XOR (message2 XOR key) = message1 XOR message2&lt;/code&gt;. This is not the same as having the plain text of either or both message1 or message2, but there is something we can do, using ASCII characteristics (it&amp;rsquo;s if it were ASCII, of course). Each letter starts with &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; in binary, but the space character starts with &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt;. Look at the possible combinations:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;m trying to untangle a very confusing notion for some people (myself included) - App Transport Security. We will have several examples to work with and then try to construct our own setting according to our requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            NSRequiresCertificateTransparency : Boolean
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above code snippet from Apple &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; shows the object that is responsible for loosening network security. This topic has been very confusing for me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got myself untangled 🎄 &amp;#x1f408;  &amp;#x1f4a1; !&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ctypes&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;cast(address, ctypes&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;py_object)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, regardless of whether you flag some &lt;code&gt;UITextField&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;em&gt;Secure Text Entry&lt;/em&gt; or not, it always returns data in the form of a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NSString&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, using the overwritten data outside the compiler&amp;rsquo;s scope (e.g., serializing it in a temp file) guarantees that it will be overwritten but obviously impacts performance and maintenance. You should try to overwrite critical objects with random data or content from non-critical objects. This will make it really difficult to construct scanners that can identify sensitive data on the basis of its management. This can be only done by low-level languages because the compilers and just-in-time virtual machines will ignore those operations for performance reasons if the optimization routines detect that the buffer is no longer used after being overwritten.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>📚 Decrypting iOS Applications</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/applications/mobile/ios-decrypting-applications/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/applications/mobile/ios-decrypting-applications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several tools available that perform decryption of iOS applications. iOS applications that are downloaded from AppStore are encrypted. AppStore simply won&amp;rsquo;t allow to upload an app without proper signature and encryption. To get .ipa from the device for further analysis one needs a tool. There are several tools available now (October, 2020). I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a simple overview of the differences and how they work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a single application (in my case it was Bear) and decrypted it using several different tools. Frida-is-dumo and CrackerXI+ had the same output (md5 matches), clucth had a difference in several bytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alternate data streams. Specific for Windows. See more &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/dfir/forensic-investigation/reference/windows/win-ads&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Are there such streams for other OS? If yes, how to make them and discover them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure compatability between NTFS and HFS. Allows hiding files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;C:\type C:\mal.exe &amp;gt; C:\readme.txt&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;naughty.exe

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# to run&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;innocent.exe
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;dir /r&lt;/code&gt; - will display &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; streams. LNS and Sfind will hunt down such files. Also, when you copy files from and to a FAT partition - all residual files will be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Turning Off Logging</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/antiforensics/logs-turnoff/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/antiforensics/logs-turnoff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Apple&amp;rsquo;s official documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the contents of a volume are sufficiently secret that it is not appropriate to log them. To disable logging on a per-volume basis (for creating a backup volume, for example), you must do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Create a &lt;code&gt;.fseventsd&lt;/code&gt; directory at the top level of the volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Create an empty &lt;code&gt;no_log&lt;/code&gt; file in that directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your volume is mounted at &lt;code&gt;/Volumes/MyDisk&lt;/code&gt;, you would create an empty file called &lt;code&gt;/Volumes/MyDisk/.fseventsd/no_log&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/artefacts/fs/ssd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a general overview of how SSD works and how it&amp;rsquo;s different from an HDD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSDs consist of NAND memory chips, a power terminal and a data terminal. Due to its nature, data cannot be overwritten, therefore, it needs to be white clean first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔎 Does it mean that there is no data in the unallocated or slack space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is written in pages and deleted in blocks (multiple pages).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a general overview of how HDDs work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;floppy&#34;&gt;Floppy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floppy disks &amp;#x1f4be; are like dinosaurs 🦕. They are ancient, not usually used nowadays. But the mechanism is very much like the one found in an HDD that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it useful to start the intro to HDD from a simplier mechanism. In the square brackerts I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving an analogy with a person reading a book (inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.takeupcode.com/podcast/226-filesystem-chs-vs-lba-modes/&#34;&gt;takeupcode.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two broad categories of Windows core processes. Processes that initialize system environment and those that initialize the user environment. Whatever is the category, you need to know them well in order to detect abnormal things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, there are some prerequisites that one needs to have in order to get this exploit. These are what are BootROM, NOR, &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; and heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About BootROM you can read here. Briefly speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ead &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;nly &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;emory (thus ROM, not to be confused with RAM which stands for &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;andomly &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ccessed &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;emory, i.e. RAM and refers to the chip that&amp;rsquo;s being freed of any charge when the power is off). ROM only means that this part of the device cannot be in any way modified once it was produced: neither by the user, not by the manufacturer himself. Mobile devices use ROM to store the first step of CPU launch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Calling 🤙 Conventions in x86</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/malware/analyse/basics/assebly/assembly-calling-conventions/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 16:31:05 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/malware/analyse/basics/assebly/assembly-calling-conventions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;m giving an overview of different calling conventions with examples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mysteriousFunction&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; b)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; b &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; c;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mysteriousFunction&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// then the above function is called 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see the assembly code for each calling convention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cdecl&#34;&gt;CDECL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output in assemble would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-assembly&#34; data-lang=&#34;assembly&#34;&gt;_mysteriousFunction:
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
mov eax, [ebp + 8]
mov edx, [ebp + 12]
add eax, edx
pop ebp
ret
and

;main function
push 4 ; the second argument is pushed first
push 2 ; the first argument is pushed second
call _mysteriousFunction
add esp, 8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is clearly seen from the above snippet, the arguments to the function are passed in reverse order by means of &lt;code&gt;PUSH&lt;/code&gt; instruction (placed on stack). Observe the &lt;code&gt;_mysteriousFunction&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s code: values added to &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;, but nothing seems to be returning, just &lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s because this calling convention passes return values in &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; register by default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Its full name is &lt;em&gt;carry flag&lt;/em&gt;. Its main purpose is to tell that the resulting number after some operations is too much to bear for the registry size. For example, the maximum size of a number is 32 bit, but if we add 0xFFFF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zf&#34;&gt;ZF&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Operations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/ttp/malware/analyse/basics/assebly/assembly-operations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;m describing all assembly operations that I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered myseld and also wasn&amp;rsquo;t lazy anough to put down an explanation about here. However, I won&amp;rsquo;t be paying much attention to some operation that I consider straightforward, like &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to put a flag for each operation indicating corresponding arch: &lt;code&gt;arm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;x86&lt;/code&gt; (just learning ARM myself for iOS analysis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of instruction have the following anatomy: &lt;code&gt;instruction &amp;lt;destination operand&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;source operand&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Some operations look like this: &lt;code&gt;instruction &amp;lt;source operand&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;destination operand&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is always the same register (default). An example: &lt;code&gt;MUL&lt;/code&gt;. When &lt;code&gt;MUL&lt;/code&gt;ing, you always multiply &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; on some value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the strings &lt;code&gt;fs strings&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;radare2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rabin -zz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find &lt;code&gt;xrefs&lt;/code&gt; for the strings of interest &lt;code&gt;axt @ str.blahblah&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the input&amp;rsquo;s length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crackme-1&#34;&gt;Crackme #1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one I had to do when applying for a job a while ago. I knew nothing about reverse engineering at that time and little I knew about assembly. And it was the time when I found out about crackme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any cracking career is supposed to start with solving simple crackme&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;ve not been doing it all the time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve solved several of them from the simplest to a very hard one which required some math knowledge 😬. This allowed me to craft some sort of algorithm I would like to share.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Execution Policy&lt;/strong&gt;. Powershell execution policy is applied to scripts only. Here are the main policies used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; Unrestricted &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# everything is allowed (dangerous)&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beautiful Python &amp;#x1f40d;, which has so many small blocks of code that ease the task so much! Here is my collection of these building blocks that can be applied to many every day challenges. I am sure some or even all of them might be present in other languages as well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know other languages equally well, so, pardon my Python &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a task. We are given an array (which is actually a list) of dictionaries. Something like a score log (may be a tiny NoSQL DB). For example:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/netlayer/arp/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/protocols/netlayer/arp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is about ARP protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s used to map IP addresses to physical (MAC) addresses. Devices usually keep an ARP cache not to send ARP request continuously. Also there are certain attacks on ARP that exploit its internals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analogy&#34;&gt;Analogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to compare a device to a human body, we could say that CPU is a brain 🧠, battery power is a heart ♥️, camera is an eye 👁 and NIC is a mouth 👄 (yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s forget about microphones 🎤 for a while).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ICMP protocol is needed for troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an TCP/IP stack here is what ICMP request looks like in a frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/icmp_request_packet.png&#34; alt=&#34;icmp_request_packet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though ICMP belongs itself to the network layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is some problem during any requst (HTTP, FTP or any other request on any other layer), ICMP error response might be sent. Its type can help in troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;message-types&#34;&gt;Message Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each message type will have a different header.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is about IP protocol (v4, v6 and IPX).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ipv4&#34;&gt;IPv4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number on top and along the left edge are bits (not bytes). The addresses itselves are 32 bits long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reserved-addresses&#34;&gt;Reserved Addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;10.255.255.255&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;172.16.0.0&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;172.31.255.255&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.0.0&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;192.168.255.255&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one host can receive and read a message. Other PCs will discard it (unless in a promiscuous mode or on a hub).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article collects the basics of TCP protocol. Its friend UDP (transport layer protocol as well) is faster but less reliable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desired prerequisite for this article is &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/articles/fundamentals/network/osi/overview&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s also recommended to read about &lt;strong&gt;data structures&lt;/strong&gt;.  A very good book that I&amp;rsquo;ve accidenatlly stumbled upon is Brian Carrier&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;File System Forensic Analysis&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. I also strongly believe, that the best way to learn is to activate different parts of the brain. Simple reading is not enough, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m trying to mix in pictures and emoji. Also, metaphors help and analogies which I also try to provide. But it would really help, if you installed some packet capture program (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wireshark.org/download.html&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; is an example), opened some network interface and observed the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m talking about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone has violated corporate policy by watching porn using the corp PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have the authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the expected results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some prohibited internet traffic&lt;/strong&gt;. Check network logs of an application layer firewall 🔥 or content filter (any gateway between the suspect and the network), filter them out. But the user was smart enough to use VPN. What&amp;rsquo;s then? Application layer firewall only sees application traffic, it is not aware of TCPs, Shudipis and etc. Read &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/articles/fundamentals/network/osi/overview&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article about TCP/IP stack to understand better why application layer firewalls won&amp;rsquo;t see anything other than what&amp;rsquo;s on top.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all IP (intellectual property) are recreated by a competitor. Investigate the development machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential data exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;netstat -lpeanut&lt;/code&gt; shows that there are two dhcp clients running, one using unusual port and user:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps aux | grep 40500&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ps aux | grep dhclient&lt;/code&gt; shows the running processes and sometimes commands used to run them. This suspicious client was run from &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/5.png&#34; alt=&#34;img5&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -la /tmp/&lt;/code&gt; to see the file that was launched. But nothing there. Seems that the file was deleted after being launched:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;netstat&lt;/code&gt;, see the weird python script with established connection to some remote host:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/10.png&#34; alt=&#34;mg10&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab the executable: &lt;code&gt;lsof -p 2082&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ps aux  grep 2082&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/11.png&#34; alt=&#34;img11&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see the &lt;code&gt;/tmp/&lt;/code&gt; folder for &lt;code&gt;backdoor&lt;/code&gt; executable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check &lt;code&gt;/proc/2082&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/12.png&#34; alt=&#34;img12&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the executable is a legitimate python, need to explore further. In &lt;code&gt;/proc/2082&lt;/code&gt; run &lt;code&gt;sudo cat cmdline&lt;/code&gt; shows the comand used to launch, &lt;code&gt;cat task/2082/children&lt;/code&gt; shows children PID. &lt;code&gt;sudo cat status&lt;/code&gt; shows  general information. &lt;code&gt;cat environ&lt;/code&gt; shows &amp;hellip; . &lt;code&gt;cat arp&lt;/code&gt; shows MAC addresses of the machines connected:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP theft and Kali Linux is a suspect. Has the user exfiltrated pictures or documents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can look for info in xdg directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.cache&lt;/code&gt; ($XDG_CACHE_HOME)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.local/share&lt;/code&gt; ($XDG_DATA_HOME)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.config&lt;/code&gt; ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can look for info in non-xdg dirs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.&amp;lt;application_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; (user home dir)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat .bash_history&lt;/code&gt; and defaults in &lt;code&gt;./bashrc&lt;/code&gt;. For Kali &lt;code&gt;~/.msf4/history&lt;/code&gt; (doesn&amp;rsquo;t log commands for the remote shell), &lt;code&gt;~/.nc_history&lt;/code&gt; (created if &lt;code&gt;rlwrap &lt;/code&gt; was used to run &lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt;. Also &lt;code&gt;~/.viminfo&lt;/code&gt;: cmd history, string search history, input-line history, contents of non-empty regs, marks for several files, file marks pointing to locs in files, last search/sub pattern for &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rsquo;, buffer list, global vars. &lt;code&gt;~/.cache/sessions&lt;/code&gt; - by xfce-session and only if sessions are saved: list of open progs that were saved from last session (when the user last logged out) for recent Kalis. Xfce-session-[hostname]:0 and &lt;code&gt;.bak&lt;/code&gt; - prev version of it. Client - prog or windows that needs to be opened. At the end of the file the amount of progs that are to be run and last time this session was last saved (not opened by user ). XFWM - xfce window manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A software that could be used for anti-forensics. By default, configs are at &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; and named &lt;code&gt;usbkill.ini&lt;/code&gt;. The default behaviour - shut the system down. Keeps a whitelist of allowed USB devices. Can also prevent malware from getting on the PC from a USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogues: BusKill (set a &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt; rule to be triggered if the USB drive is removed: lock, shutdown or self-destruct) and Silk Guardian (Linux Kernel mode switch that&amp;rsquo;s waiting for a change, deletes files on events and shuts the system down).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/applications/mobile/ios-btfm-rtfm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a combination of BTFM and RTFM (Blue Team Field Manual and Red Team Field Manual) for iOS devices and applications. I used to keep two separate field manuals at first, but since there are just too many intersections, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to combine them to make it easier to use. For Android RTFM and BTFM see &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/toolkit/manuals/android-btfm-rtfm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Met Fragment Injection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moscow has again become Mordor-like, the Sun is starting to make its heat more official rather than genuine because it&amp;rsquo;s getting desperately cold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; Android Studio 4.0.1, built on June, 25, 2020 (Runtime version: 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593 X86_64, VM: OpenJDK 64-bit Server VM by JetbBrains s.r.o.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05:35 am&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x1f62a; Even though I went to sleep too late yesterday (due to my wushu 🧎🏽‍♀️practice and a bath I had to take to help my muscles overcome the shock of such an unusual physical activity after almoust a year of turning into a very pretty and round stump of a tree and covering with moss after several months of coronavirus-driven self-isolation), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep my eyes shut because I was so obsesed by and absorbed with the idea of my new project: Android Exploiter. So, I tried to fall asleep (just for appearance&amp;rsquo;s sake) for about 40 minutes, but since my husband has already gotten up and my little three-year old daughter as well, seemed no use to insist. So, I got up and was about to go to the kitchen, but was stuck by my laptop once again&amp;hellip; Why this stupid application is not running? What am I doing wrong. &amp;#x1f621; That day I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly left the table&amp;hellip;👩🏽‍💻&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>📚 ApplePay, GooglePay, SamsungPay</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/attacks/applications/mobile/mobile-payment-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Options: Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsumg Pay, Amazon Pay, Visa Checkout and PayPal. I think there are more,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6978379172934991873/&#34;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6978379172934991873/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;samsung-pay&#34;&gt;Samsung Pay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to add SamsungPay as well (former LoopPay), when I get how it works and how it differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ВНИМАНИЕ. Samsung Pay ранее поддерживал технологию MST. Это бесконтактные платежи без &lt;a href=&#34;https://nastroyvse.ru/devices/raznoe/chto-delat-esli-net-nfc-modulya.html&#34;&gt;использования NFC&lt;/a&gt;. Вместо данного модуля использовался магнитный, позволявший совершить покупку даже на устаревших терминалах. Но в новых моделях смартфонов от &lt;a href=&#34;https://nastroyvse.ru/opersys/android/mst-v-smartfone.html&#34;&gt;использования MST&lt;/a&gt; отказались, так как сейчас 99% магазинов установили POS-терминалы с поддержкой более защищённого NFC [&lt;a href=&#34;https://nastroyvse.ru/programs/rating/platyozhnaya-sistema-android-pay-apple-pay-samsung-pay.html&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;attacking-device&#34;&gt;Attacking device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this attack there are several types of attacker:
•  MiM, i.e. a sniffer. This person is using the same network and intercepting traffic. What does that attacker need?
•  Mobile phone is stolen
•  Exploit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;attacking-applications&#34;&gt;Attacking applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this attack there are more types of attacker:
•  MiM - same network, certificate to install (if HTTP), setting attacker as proxy. If the person has enabled and forgotten to disable adb tcpip, you can connect from a trusted PC.
•  Stolen phone - PIN and DE circumvent, rooting (for acquiring some data), developer’s mode on
•  Malicious application - persuade the user to install an app. Preferably, gain maximum possible permissions. If rooted - big celebration.
•  Exploit - export written, physical access or access over network (depends on exploit), or malicious application installed (see above).
•  Malicious user - an application with bugs. For example, a user of e-banking has found a way to circumvent commission for transactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Ничего так, тепло.*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Где-то в тёмном-тёмном лесу, среди высоких старых деревьев, притаившись в кустах выжидают свою жертву хищники. И даже несмотря на то, что они могут быть не такими страшными, как товарищ из фильма, тем не менее могут принести немало проблем. Мало кто воспринимает интернет как &amp;ldquo;страшный и таинственный лес&amp;rdquo;, но тем не менее в какой-то степени так и есть. И хищники там тоже есть, и поверьте мне, они не такие милые как пушистое создание на картинке.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open me! I am a payment order! I am important, I swear!&amp;rdquo;, - some RTF-file was yelling. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting any bills so this slyboots did not maim my poor little laptop. Phew ! Lucky me! But since this was a social engineering attack (not very crafty but still), someone less concerned with his or her safety could have opened it and cause him- or herself a lot of trouble. What I am trying to say (very inarticulately ) is that simply opening a small RTF document could result in absolute disaster for your machine! In this post I am telling the story how exactly does it happen&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Приятно бывает встретиться лицом к лицу с сильным противником, потому что именно в такие моменты, после таких &amp;ldquo;битв&amp;rdquo;, становишься сильнее. Прошедший вторник оказался настоящим вызовом для моей смекалки. Ну здравствуй, Confuser! Очень надеюсь, что вам понравится статья точно так же, как мне понравилось ковырять этот код и писать эту скромную статью. Все началось одним облачным утром&amp;hellip;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He also was very  absent-minded and has lost some of his secret keys. He met a bird &amp;#x1f414; Marvin and said: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marvin, my memory is no good, here are all my keys &amp;#x1f511;&amp;#x1f511;&amp;#x1f511;&amp;#x1f511; , I will just retain this small key-card &amp;#x1f3b4; which I will show you to prove it&amp;rsquo;s really me. Whenever I need a key, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you this card. You give me the key &amp;#x1f511; temporary and then take it back after I used it &amp;#x1f510; .&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Marvin was a very responsible guy and he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtualization-vs-cloud&#34;&gt;Virtualization vs Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;PROS&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;CONS&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;flexibility, agility and choices&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Security?&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;scale, efficiency and cost&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;might be hard to change providers (lock)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;simplicity, encapsulated change management&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;lack of control (patches, for example)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Up-to-date technologies&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Reliability&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types&#34;&gt;Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public (tenant) - most common. Share resources with other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private - don&amp;rsquo;t share resources. More security and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid - the part of the business that needs to grow uses the public option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-directories&#34;&gt;Main Directories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; - for binary executables. Common commands are found here - &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; etc. These are basic programs for proper OS operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sbin&lt;/code&gt; - same but more about &lt;strong&gt;system maintainance&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;code&gt;lptables&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reboot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fdisk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;etc&lt;/code&gt; - configurations for user accounts and programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; - files that expected to grow and change contantly. Contains &lt;code&gt;/var/logs&lt;/code&gt; for surprise-surprise&amp;hellip; wait for it&amp;hellip; logs. Wow! 😯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; - contains temprory files, which are deleted on system reboot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Met Hugo</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/blog/2020/09/how-i-met-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 13:45:07 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/blog/2020/09/how-i-met-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when I was desperately trying to become a web programmer (those wonderful days of naïve curiosity🤦‍♀️). I’ve even attended a course (which turned out to be useless&amp;hellip; If only I knew back then, that I could better learn it all for free on my own. Alas!😭).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created some repulsive HTML pages with a crappy JavaScript🤮. I remember one of the first projects: a page with a binary converter🙌. Some time later, when I’ve found a job as a C# programmer, I’ve met the beauty of asp.net (&lt;a href=&#34;http://asp.net/&#34;&gt;http://asp.net/&lt;/a&gt;) and realized I don’t have to deal with php (which my soft mental constitution could not bear 👸) and that I don’t always have to write  websites from scratch and what’s more, to develop the design for it myself&amp;hellip; After I’ve started my career in InfoSec field, I’ve stumbled upon a task which I managed to solve with .net web engine and my beloved C#. But the site was as usual, not very pretty, to say the least&amp;hellip; Actually, I’ve tried to copy VisualStudio styles and managed partly, but it was like a 5 year old trying to copy Tician. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My name&amp;rsquo;s Veronica Zvereva, and I&amp;rsquo;m a security analyst. I&amp;rsquo;m jolly excited and proud of what I do. My job is my hobby and my passion. My IT education has mostly been self-study since I got my first PC around 2008 or 2009. In those days, I believed ICQ was like a PC number (similar to a phone number) plastered on the desktop. That PC was put together by many IT enthusiasts at our local IT market, and it was an absolute calamity! Every month or so, it would do something outrageous, pushing the boundaries of what I considered the worst PC could be. I could expect any horror from it: sudden shutdowns, throwing me back to square one and forcing me to start again, or freezing so solidly that I felt I was freezing too, but more out of desperation. It could also give me a dreaded &amp;ldquo;blue screen&amp;rdquo;. Every day was a &amp;ldquo;surprise&amp;rdquo;. Not long after this &amp;ldquo;treasure,&amp;rdquo; I purchased my first router (as if one wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough), which was equally frustrating. Soon after buying it, it began demanding daily resets and reconfigurations (almost every day), and neither the IPS nor the router&amp;rsquo;s tech support was of any help. Both (I mean the PC and the router) ended up in our hallway several years later and were snatched up by some unsuspecting neighbour. I often complained about those two precious &amp;ldquo;fellas,&amp;rdquo; but now I appreciate how valuable they became. They both compelled me to delve into IT and laid the foundation for my IT mindset, eventually leading me to become who I am today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
