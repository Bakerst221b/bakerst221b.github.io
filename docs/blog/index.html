        <p> <i><p><em>One sunny 😎 day I came to a coworking office very early in the morning. As usual, I&rsquo;ve decided to kick it off with a freshly brewed coffee which we never had, so, I had to go with an instant substitute. Ugh 😣! I was hoping to savour my disgust meditating over the Feedly recents, when I noticed that I was not the only lark that day. Mark, a freelance designer who happened to be a huge fan of Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games (just like me), was sitting in the corner of the shared kitchen with his laptop, looking so gloomy that I was sorry I didn&rsquo;t take my ☔️ with me. When I&rsquo;ve forced the last sip of that potion inside, I wished him good morning and headed to my working nest. He didn&rsquo;t respond though, which was weird, since he usually was very friendly. I thought he needed some time on his own and was about to leave the kitchen when suddenly he hailed me. Long story short, he seemed to get himself a virus and didn&rsquo;t know how to get rid of it. He seemed scared, since lots of important files were encrypted.</em></p></i></p>

<p>It was a cloudy Sunday morning. I was sleeping peacefully till 8:45 AM when my daughter started crawling all over me and my husband asking wether I am awake already&hellip; . Well, now I am, darling, many thanks 🤦🏻‍♀️! After having a delicious breakfast (eggplants with home-made tomato sauce, yummy 😋) and getting the kitchen back to the clean state (it&rsquo;s very hard to keep it that way), I&rsquo;ve decided to finally repair my little old fellow iPhone 7. Several weeks ago I went on vocation to Cyprus and broke the rare camera glass and the screen as well, because I somehow managed to drop the phone on the pavement 3 ❗️times! To be honest, these were not the first times when my iPhone met some surface harder than my palm, so it&rsquo;s a miracle this had not happened before.</p></i></p>

        <p> <i><p><em>In this blog post I am exploring AWS services (EC2). I am currently using a Free Tier license and I am trying to learn how to use. Why? Well, knowing AWS seems to be a very useful skill on the market. And the second reason for that is that I used to have different VMs that cosumed too much memory (HDD and RAM). Now I am also using M1 MacBook Pro and that&rsquo;s why having so many VMs locally is impossible since there are only some Linux and Windows 10 Machines available for ARM platform. Besides, I&rsquo;ve notices that I don&rsquo;t really use them much so having 60 GB of space occupied for occasional usage is weird. Everything speaks in the favour of AWS.</em></p></i></p>

<p>First, I had to sign up to Microsoft Insider Program <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64?wa=wsignin1.0">here</a>. It was free and I signed up. Then, I&rsquo;ve installed Parallels from <a href="https://b2b.parallels.com/apple-silicon">here</a> using &ldquo;Try technical preview&rdquo; option that was available at this point in time. Also, at this point of time a free activation key &#x1f511; was available for Parallels (thank you 🙏 so much, guys, for this) <a href="https://my.parallels.com/desktop/beta?_ga=2.154508411.2118090463.1614625046-817269375.1614625046">here</a>. During installation process I was a little bewildered by the question about the use purpose of this software&hellip; Gaming or ordinary use (text editing, web-browsing etc). I&rsquo;ve chosen &ldquo;Gaming&rdquo; since I presume Autopsy and software alike do consume much power. However, I&rsquo;m not sure if this option changes the performance or it&rsquo;s rather some survey. Anyway. After all that everything worked like a charm.

        <p> <i><p>There was a time when I was desperately trying to become a web programmer (those wonderful days of naïve curiosity🤦‍♀️). I’ve even attended a course (which turned out to be useless&hellip; If only I knew back then, that I could better learn it all for free on my own. Alas!😭).</p>
<p>So I created some repulsive HTML pages with a crappy JavaScript🤮. I remember one of the first projects: a page with a binary converter🙌. Some time later, when I’ve found a job as a C# programmer, I’ve met the beauty of asp.net (<a href="http://asp.net/">http://asp.net/</a>) and realized I don’t have to deal with php (which my soft mental constitution could not bear 👸) and that I don’t always have to write  websites from scratch and what’s more, to develop the design for it myself&hellip; After I’ve started my career in InfoSec field, I’ve stumbled upon a task which I managed to solve with .net web engine and my beloved C#. But the site was as usual, not very pretty, to say the least&hellip; Actually, I’ve tried to copy VisualStudio styles and managed partly, but it was like a 5 year old trying to copy Tician. Almost.</p></i></p>

<p>*<strong>Ничего так, тепло.*</strong></p>
<p><em>Где-то в тёмном-тёмном лесу, среди высоких старых деревьев, притаившись в кустах выжидают свою жертву хищники. И даже несмотря на то, что они могут быть не такими страшными, как товарищ из фильма, тем не менее могут принести немало проблем. Мало кто воспринимает интернет как &ldquo;страшный и таинственный лес&rdquo;, но тем не менее в какой-то степени так и есть. И хищники там тоже есть, и поверьте мне, они не такие милые как пушистое создание на картинке.</em></p></i></p>

        <p> <i><p><em><strong>Thursday</strong></em>, <em><strong>Warm and cloudy.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Open me! I am a payment order! I am important, I swear!&rdquo;, - some RTF-file was yelling. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting any bills so this slyboots did not maim my poor little laptop. Phew ! Lucky me! But since this was a social engineering attack (not very crafty but still), someone less concerned with his or her safety could have opened it and cause him- or herself a lot of trouble. What I am trying to say (very inarticulately ) is that simply opening a small RTF document could result in absolute disaster for your machine! In this post I am telling the story how exactly does it happen&hellip;</em></p></i></p>

        <p> <i><p><em>Вторник, прохладно, как будто вот-вот пойдет дождь, но нет&hellip;. Приятно бывает встретиться лицом к лицу с сильным противником, потому что именно в такие моменты, после таких &ldquo;битв&rdquo;, становишься сильнее. Прошедший вторник оказался настоящим вызовом для моей смекалки. Ну здравствуй, Confuser! Очень надеюсь, что вам понравится статья точно так же, как мне понравилось ковырять этот код и писать эту скромную статью. Все началось одним облачным утром&hellip;.</em></p>
