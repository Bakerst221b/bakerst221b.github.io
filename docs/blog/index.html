        <p> <i><p><em>One sunny 😎 day I came to a coworking office very early in the morning. As usual, I&rsquo;ve decided to kick it off with a freshly brewed coffee which we never had, so, I had to go with an instant substitute. Ugh 😣! I was hoping to savour my disgust meditating over the Feedly recents, when I noticed that I was not the only lark that day. Mark, a freelance designer who happened to be a huge fan of Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games (just like me), was sitting in the corner of the shared kitchen with his laptop, looking so gloomy that I was sorry I didn&rsquo;t take my ☔️ with me. When I&rsquo;ve forced the last sip of that potion inside, I wished him good morning and headed to my working nest. He didn&rsquo;t respond though, which was weird, since he usually was very friendly. I thought he needed some time on his own and was about to leave the kitchen when suddenly he hailed me. Long story short, he seemed to get himself a virus and didn&rsquo;t know how to get rid of it. He seemed scared, since lots of important files were encrypted.</em></p></i></p>

<p>A very hard-working girl, let&rsquo;s call her Rachel (yeah, Rachel 😉) was sitting at her table, working as usual when she suddenly saw her phone vibrating nearby.

<p>🕰 <code>11:21 AM</code>.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy Sunday morning. I was sleeping peacefully till 8:45 AM when my daughter started crawling all over me and my husband asking wether I am awake already&hellip; . Well, now I am, darling, many thanks 🤦🏻‍♀️! After having a delicious breakfast (eggplants with home-made tomato sauce, yummy 😋) and getting the kitchen back to the clean state (it&rsquo;s very hard to keep it that way), I&rsquo;ve decided to finally repair my little old fellow iPhone 7. Several weeks ago I went on vocation to Cyprus and broke the rare camera glass and the screen as well, because I somehow managed to drop the phone on the pavement 3 ❗️times! To be honest, these were not the first times when my iPhone met some surface harder than my palm, so it&rsquo;s a miracle this had not happened before.</p></i></p>

        <p> <i><p><em>In this blog post I am exploring AWS services (EC2). I am currently using a Free Tier license and I am trying to learn how to use. Why? Well, knowing AWS seems to be a very useful skill on the market. And the second reason for that is that I used to have different VMs that cosumed too much memory (HDD and RAM). Now I am also using M1 MacBook Pro and that&rsquo;s why having so many VMs locally is impossible since there are only some Linux and Windows 10 Machines available for ARM platform. Besides, I&rsquo;ve notices that I don&rsquo;t really use them much so having 60 GB of space occupied for occasional usage is weird. Everything speaks in the favour of AWS.</em></p></i></p>

<p>First, I had to sign up to Microsoft Insider Program <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64?wa=wsignin1.0">here</a>. It was free and I signed up. Then, I&rsquo;ve installed Parallels from <a href="https://b2b.parallels.com/apple-silicon">here</a> using &ldquo;Try technical preview&rdquo; option that was available at this point in time. Also, at this point of time a free activation key &#x1f511; was available for Parallels (thank you 🙏 so much, guys, for this) <a href="https://my.parallels.com/desktop/beta?_ga=2.154508411.2118090463.1614625046-817269375.1614625046">here</a>. During installation process I was a little bewildered by the question about the use purpose of this software&hellip; Gaming or ordinary use (text editing, web-browsing etc). I&rsquo;ve chosen &ldquo;Gaming&rdquo; since I presume Autopsy and software alike do consume much power. However, I&rsquo;m not sure if this option changes the performance or it&rsquo;s rather some survey. Anyway. After all that everything worked like a charm.
