      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this blog post I am exploring AWS services (EC2). I am currently using a Free Tier license and I am trying to learn how to use. Why? Well, knowing AWS seems to be a very useful skill on the market. And the second reason for that is that I used to have different VMs that cosumed too much memory (HDD and RAM). Now I am also using M1 MacBook Pro and that&amp;rsquo;s why having so many VMs locally is impossible since there are only some Linux and Windows 10 Machines available for ARM platform. Besides, I&amp;rsquo;ve notices that I don&amp;rsquo;t really use them much so having 60 GB of space occupied for occasional usage is weird. Everything speaks in the favour of AWS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
