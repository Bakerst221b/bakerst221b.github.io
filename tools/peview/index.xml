      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to dive into certain pecularities of how programs are outlined both in RAM and on disk when working as a malware analyst. One part of my job was to treat infected files. For that purpose I wrote remedy scripts. For them to work I had to have a solid underatanding where to perform the amputation. Since the topic might be a little confusing, I&amp;rsquo;ve published it here. Originally it was hand-written in my &amp;#x1f48e; notebook &amp;#x1f4d3;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
