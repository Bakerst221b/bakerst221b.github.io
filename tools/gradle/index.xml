      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moscow has again become Mordor-like, the Sun is starting to make its heat more official rather than genuine because it&amp;rsquo;s getting desperately cold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; Android Studio 4.0.1, built on June, 25, 2020 (Runtime version: 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593 X86_64, VM: OpenJDK 64-bit Server VM by JetbBrains s.r.o.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05:35 am&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x1f62a; Even though I went to sleep too late yesterday (due to my wushu 🧎🏽‍♀️practice and a bath I had to take to help my muscles overcome the shock of such an unusual physical activity after almoust a year of turning into a very pretty and round stump of a tree and covering with moss after several months of coronavirus-driven self-isolation), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep my eyes shut because I was so obsesed by and absorbed with the idea of my new project: Android Exploiter. So, I tried to fall asleep (just for appearance&amp;rsquo;s sake) for about 40 minutes, but since my husband has already gotten up and my little three-year old daughter as well, seemed no use to insist. So, I got up and was about to go to the kitchen, but was stuck by my laptop once again&amp;hellip; Why this stupid application is not running? What am I doing wrong. &amp;#x1f621; That day I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly left the table&amp;hellip;👩🏽‍💻&lt;/p&gt;</description>
