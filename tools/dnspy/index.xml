      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One sunny 😎 day I came to a coworking office very early in the morning. As usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to kick it off with a freshly brewed coffee which we never had, so, I had to go with an instant substitute. Ugh 😣! I was hoping to savour my disgust meditating over the Feedly recents, when I noticed that I was not the only lark that day. Mark, a freelance designer who happened to be a huge fan of Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed games (just like me), was sitting in the corner of the shared kitchen with his laptop, looking so gloomy that I was sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t take my ☔️ with me. When I&amp;rsquo;ve forced the last sip of that potion inside, I wished him good morning and headed to my working nest. He didn&amp;rsquo;t respond though, which was weird, since he usually was very friendly. I thought he needed some time on his own and was about to leave the kitchen when suddenly he hailed me. Long story short, he seemed to get himself a virus and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to get rid of it. He seemed scared, since lots of important files were encrypted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
