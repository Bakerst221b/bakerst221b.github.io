      <description>&lt;p&gt;📆 &lt;code&gt;22/08/2021&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, ☁️&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;🕰 &lt;code&gt;11:21 AM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a cloudy Sunday morning. I was sleeping peacefully till 8:45 AM when my daughter started crawling all over me and my husband asking wether I am awake already&amp;hellip; . Well, now I am, darling, many thanks 🤦🏻‍♀️! After having a delicious breakfast (eggplants with home-made tomato sauce, yummy 😋) and getting the kitchen back to the clean state (it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to keep it that way), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to finally repair my little old fellow iPhone 7. Several weeks ago I went on vocation to Cyprus and broke the rare camera glass and the screen as well, because I somehow managed to drop the phone on the pavement 3 ❗️times! To be honest, these were not the first times when my iPhone met some surface harder than my palm, so it&amp;rsquo;s a miracle this had not happened before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
